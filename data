So coldHOLY SHIT  I WOKE UP WVEYRONE SLEEPINGThat mad man did it fucking againFinished businessThat pretty much ended the Westbrook vs Lillard debateDAME JUST DID THAT TO THEM.[His first shot of this series](https://streamable.com/x452l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)WHAT THE FUCK FUCK FUCK THAT WAS FUCKING LEGENDARYEVERYBODY GET IN HEREIncredibleHoly fuckI AM WITNESSDAME TIME!!![deleted]Ow.Yo, he‚Äôs a bad man.Everyone‚Äôs been saying he needed another signature moment, well here it is.does dame have the most series ending buzzer beaters in nba history? does someone have the stats on this?You know what kind of insane confidence you gotta have to shoot that fucking shot with these exact circumstances, over PG13???  I love Playoff Basketball.The sheer fucking audacity of that shot. No drive to the rim. No shake-n-bake. Just a good damn buzzer-beating, series-ending step-back three from fucking 40ft. Man....brb, bout to go buy a Dame jersey real fastHonestly how can anyone not like Damien Lillardabout to be most up voted thread in NBA historyWell, good thing these shorts are easily replaceable...Alpha chad Damian Lillard vs. Incel virgin Russel WestbrookPaul George having a good whine about it afterwards too: "That's a bad, bad shot," George said. "I don't care what anybody says. That's a bad shot. But hey, he made it. That story won't be told that it was a bad shot."  Fairly typical of the childish bullshit we‚Äôve seen from OKC players this series.I JUST CAMMEEE SO HARDWTF!  That was nuts!4K points in 4 minutes. Holy shitCan someone ask schroder what time it is?This could break r/nba straight to the fucking top of all time.I never thought a step back jumper could hurt me physically lol. It hurts. It broke my heart , but I couldn‚Äôt help but smile when Dame hit that shot. I think the entire world knew it was going in. Ice cold. Congrats Portland.we out here in oakland wearing logo lillard jerseysHoly shit most upvoted post on this sub in under a dayI read that in LeBrons voice lmao[HANG THAT BANNER BOYS](https://i.imgur.com/iObws61.jpg)The sickest part is that that shot was just his plan.  It's not like OKC forced him into only a 40 footer.The fucking audacity to not even ask for a screen and just hit it from the logoWho the fuck actually takes thatWhen yeet for distance and kobe for accuracy combineThat was one of the most amazing sports moments I've watched. Dame is cold as fucking ice. The definition of clutch.The madman did it again!I volunteer the Warriors to experience this next who says no#PORTLAND PLEASE BE IN THE FINALSWay more enjoyable watching it happen to someone else.HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT"It's Lillard!  He GOT THE SHOT OFF!"Does it get better?Dame sends his regardsthis is the regular around here for us lolRip buddyToday's even the 8 year anniversary of Roy leading the comeback against Dallas.Man, I wish I could see Roy and Dame play together.Dame is the culmination of years of heartbreak w BRoy and GregEveryone waiting for him to drive and he knew he was gonna hit from there. Ice cold. Was that the official measure? 37'?  Edit: it was 37'  Double edit: my man just said he looked at the rim and saw it was "a comfortable range"There was one 5 years ago that was pretty sick tooas soon as he put that shot up i said to myself "what the fu.. omg can't believe he made that!"Thought for sure he was going to fake forward not sideways. What a shot.The clock don‚Äôt matter. He runs on Dame time.I was so nervous watching the clock like ‚Äúdude wtf times running out make a move‚Äù and omg dude he everFrom the perspective of being pure cold blooded I think this is the greatest shot I have seen in my entire life.  He was 30 feet from the basket with plenty of time and space to make moves and get a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô shot, maybe get PG to foul him, anything. Instead he dribbles the clock out and takes a pull up jumper.  I know Jordan‚Äôs shot I remember watching it live. I know people have hit game winners as time expired before. I know Dame himself did it to send Houston home in the playoffs 5 years ago. He did that one coming off a screen as a rhythm catch and shoot on a set play with no real choice(barely any time left). This dude jus consciously decided to make this shot happen this way this time.   Un fucking real.Hope this guy gets a ring manhe knew what he was doingThat look into the camera afterwards Jesus christSo true. The perfect game-winner.You take 15 seconds off the clock to get yourself a step back 37 footer. Buh byeeeeeeeI fucking love dame so much.that was exactly what i said. The rudest, most disrespectful way to win a game. And it was glorious (and im a thunder fan)Game winner, from deeeep, to eliminate them, and to get to 50.    Nasty.HELLO 911 I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A MURDERI read this comment and thought, "I don't know man, can't be that wild." Watched video, "goddamn. That was disgusting."   Fucking unreal.What a shot. What a comeback.  One of the craziest games I‚Äôve seen in years.ONE OF THE GREATEST BUZZER BEATERS IN NBA HISTORY  HOLY FUCKLOGO LILLARDWTF DAMIAN you series-clinching slut. Waves them goodbye, too.We are now in the Damian Lillard era!! HOLY SHITLiterally unbelievable. 2 hours ago I couldn't even fathom *another* walk-off 3 game winner from 30+ feet  But I have seen the face of the Divine and His name is DamianThe human brain is simply not able to conceive thoughts that can adequately convey the level of clutch that Damian Lilliard possesses.I knew it was over when they showed the 2016 team winning in OaklandAll of OKC on suicide watch.I gotta say, this one was even better than Curry's  Also, both against OKC lmaoOnly way it would have been better is if Breen was screaming bang at the top of his lungs.This reminded me of that shot, against the thunder as wellWeird how Schroeder didn't tap his wrist at all tonight.He called seriesBALL GAMEHES DONE IT AGAIN JUST LIKE AGAINST HOUSTONBALL GAME#ARE YOU KIDDING METhat's one of the most ridiculous things I've seen.. Only needed one point, chucked up a 35ft bomb to end it..#NO OT TONIGHTFucking knew the shit was going in holy shit what a godWHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK THAT'S NOT FAIR. HE CAN'T BE THIS GOODThis has got to be one of the greatest shots of all time.Vintage ~~Game 5~~ WALK OFF game winner  Houston Rockets know the feeling  Edit: **Vintage Chokelahoma City** too  Edit: Rockets lost in 6 my b lolHow did he hit it from that farI HAVE PTSD##DAME TIME BABYITS LILLARD, HE GOT THE SHOT OFFDAME FUCKING TIMEDamn can‚Äôt remember the last time Dame hit a buzzer beater to advance in the playoffs /sLOW ENERGY RUSS CAN'T COMPARE TO HIGH ENERGY DAME15 point 4Q lead? Yea fuck that guys let‚Äôs go home.O K C YA NEXT YEARPortland had a timeout and decided not to use it.Not even mad man what a shotWithout a doubtThis is the wildest thing I‚Äôve seen in a while.##THIS IS PLAYOFF BASKETBALLfuck me, he called seriesAND BEYONDhttps://imgur.com/We99r6s  BIG DICK ENERGYOFFICER HE'S RIGHT THERE!He can't do that!lol the wave was greatBye Felicias   -DameThat wave is an instant historical memeHands down.I'm a huge Thunder fan and I'm not even mad right now. I just spent a random Tuesday night pacing around my living room like a madman and SCREAMING at my TV and watching one of the most exciting basketball games I've ever watched. Legit not even mad. It's not like OKC was going to win the title or anything. If you're gonna go out, might as well go out big! What a game from Dame. That dude is one stone cold motherfucker, and I definitely mean that as a compliment.I really thought if Blazers lost this it goes to 7, but they kept chipping. That was fantastic.> 0- Lillard  Spot on.-1- nut.Legitimately the thought process of every spectator and probably half the players on the court. Instantly legendary sequence.>HE BROKE THE ~~RECORD~~ THUNDER#DAGGERhttps://i.imgur.com/GhnfJnw.jpgWife: hasn't he don't that before  Me: Yes... Yes he has.Dame made that shot for Seattle. Every Sonics fan gave him their energy and he unleashed the Spirit Bomb.Your dad said it's fine cause Dame is his real son anyways.Your mom already told him.I legit fell off my couch. Even my roommate who doesn't give a shit about basketball was like "what the fuck"I closed my eyes at 13 seconds left, because I knew something was gonna happen... it did. Dread from it, run from it, Damian Lillard still arrivesEven after he fucked us in that game I've never been able to hate him. Dude is cold bloodedThis beats the 0.9 shot. I know that series was closer, but after getting swept in the regular season and the Thunder talking so much trash, this just tops that shot in my mind.Be free Rocket Bros...for nowIt would be insanely hilarious if you beat the Warriors only for Dame to do the shot to eliminate the Rockets.That's our fucking point guard!!!One of the best basketball moments I have EVER seen.One of the greatest playoff performances of all time right? 50 points on 50+% shooting w/ a buzzer beating game winner to end a series. Dame fucking Time...This is like one of those clips you see in the playoff commercials where its like "Playoffs, where big moments happen"Dame is fucking holographic legendary japanese version at this pointI can't imagine what it would be like to one day watch your team play, and then the next day there's no more basketball for you to care about.Yep.  At least we get to can Billy?   ^^^^^yay?So glad that shot is no longer the biggest of his careerCan‚Äôt be mad about that shot, that shit was epic.Fucking hold me and never let goI AM IN HERE I DONT EVEN CARE WE WON AGAINST THE MAGIC WTF WAS THAT SHOT LMAOSHOT OF THE YEARIt was 100% rude and I'm 100% with it>apology for poor english  >when were you when thunder dies?  >i was sat at home eating ass like grocerys  >‚Äòthunder is kill‚Äô  >‚Äòno‚ÄôAs it should be, didn't care for the old one muchHi r/allI ALREADY AM, WHAT DO I DO NOW?!‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt he driving at all, or moving closer to the arc at all? Oh right he‚Äôs Dame‚Äù was my thought processNot to be pedantic, but that was more like 75 feet.He started to call for a screen then waved it off, the mad manThere was no doubt in his mind that he was taking that shot.For real, I‚Äôm watching him just run down the clock, yelling at the screen for him to do something, then he just casually yeets a 3 over George and waves bye bye. Fucking insane.Yobe?Bucks Blazers Finals plzthe bad man hasn‚Äôt only done it to us now~~Loki~~ Rockets fans: "YES! THAT'S HOW IT FEELS!"[Rockets fans right now](https://discourse-cdn-aws1.com/boingboing/original/4X/4/7/3/473ea5fe25712887f9881b62d666f38ecdc7718b.gif)LILLARD GOT IT!!!!  GOOOOOD!!!!!  AND THE BLAZERS WIN THE SERIES!!!!No. It doesn‚Äôt leave your mind until you arrive to the conclusion that Damian Lillard is the one and only GodI haven‚Äôt stopped cryingIf you consider losing playoff games in even more embarrassing fashions better, then yesThe spirit of Roy flowed through Dame's veins tonight.   Roy's career possibly died for this moment.BRoy was great and clutch as well.   Dame is just something else...this is his moment where you realize you don't just have a great player you have an all-time great player.   I imagine it feels similar to when LeBron went for 27 straight against Detroit. It was like...oh....he's *different*.dude's gotta have a 37 foot dick to shoot that kinda shotFuck it we'll do it from 37 feetNgl this tops it. Mostly because the way he waved bye after he hit it   Edit; https://twitter.com/jasonrmcintyre/status/1120919221309829120?s=21Dame is so clutch it's insane.yep and i've constantly seen him pull up from way behind the 3 point line, but nothing like that.Knew it was over the second it left his hands, most clutch player in the league and it's not close.Over PG is what makes it even crazierI hope he stays in POR to get that ring.Let's dispel this fiction once and for all that Damian Lillard doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.Hard to know what you're doing when you're UNCONSCIOUS[Ice in his veins](https://imgur.com/qH3Jv06)In a 6‚Äô8 guy‚Äôs face.    The balls on that man.That's the epitome of BDEHe had to use all the time though. Hed rather take the chance on a crazy miss and go to OT with a 5 fouls on WB and PG than to try and pass or drive through. If he got stripped or a teammate turned it over OKC wouldve had a nice chance to attempt to win.Dude has some ice in his veins for sure. I‚Äôve been voting for him as all star for yearsWe deserve this. Fuck Clay Bennett. Shouts SeattleDAME CALLED GAMEThat wave was awesome, no talk, all action then cya suckersDame for mvp next year I don‚Äôt even careNot really trying to rub it in, but when they had KD/Russ/Harden they seemed poised to run the league for years and in the end they got zero rings out of it. They really fumbled a golden collection of talent.This one has the dope playoff narrative behind it, but something about how fast Steph got up the floor and just launched is pretty special tooTHEN WAVES BYE LMAO[deleted]It's Lillard! HE GOT THE SHOT OFF!But even better!I knew it was over when he was still that far back with 2 seconds left lmaoHe just CHOSE a half-court shotI was like "WHY HE WAITING SO LONG" then I was like SEIZING OUT IN MY BEDWHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED#LET‚ÄôS GO HOMEHOLY FUCKING DAME TIMEAnd waved goodbye to OKC. Fucking studI heard somebody say it was 37ball dameAnd he waved goodbye üòÇYOU KNOW WHAT TIME ITS IS??  DAME TIME!!!As a thunder fan I don‚Äôt think you can argue for dame being lower than top 3 pg, and top 2 is more likelyDamian Lillard and eliminating teams on absurd three pointers. Name a better time.Greatest three at the buzzer to eliminate a team since the last time Dame did it.This is an all-time great performance by Dame. Couple that with the shit talking from Westbrook and Schr√∂der this series and it was like a movie seeing him bury themThis is Dame's signature moment. Even more so than the Houston Game Winner imo.Yep one of the greatest playoff performances I‚Äôve seen in my life. Won‚Äôt ever forget thisFUCKING SHITTTT DAMNNIce fucking coldJokes on you, we lost in 6!Hey atleast you arent the victim of the greatest Lillard series winning 3 anymore!GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. AND THE BLAZERS WIN THE SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 YEARS.Chokelahoma City and Russ forcing shit = perfect recipeI'm OK with this C ya'll laterI'm stealing this thanksWAY DOWNTOWN!!! BANG!!! ... ... BANG!!!This was a tie game tooI mean u still have a right to be disappointedDude was nearly at half court, like holy fucking shit.IM FUCKING SHAKINGShoot him or something!Man downThat‚Äôs the letter O to us mortals, sir.All while staring at the hoop üëÄDagger? That was a nuke.Your dad is your grandpa now, that's how fucked this shot wasGive your roommate a nother fucking high five.The memes would be vicious, but I‚Äôm so desperate to see a finals without the warriors I‚Äôd be downFor real, that was a fucking incredible game start to finish... BUT THAT FINISH!LMAO üòÇ I didn't get it until I saw your flairJesus Christ this we got a double homicide tonightFBOOM ROASTED.  There you are, you friendly savage.Oofhey at least next year we might be able to call good timeoutsNot sure what you're talking about. This is his first game winner in the playoffs, as I recall.not at the shot, at the plays before it. Choked so hard.  Congrats to portland.That's the stuff of legends.DUDE WE'RE THE MAGIC WE'LL BE FINE! LET'S ALL PILE ON OKC FOR NOW!You watched this game while eating ass?  My manI just stood up and said "do it dame. Acsend". Series winner. Secure 50 points. Was just to perfect."I'm Damien Lillard. Y'all know who I am"I was sitting there thinking "GO THERE'S 2 SECONDS LEFT!" Can't believe he had the guts to take a step back three from almost 40 feet out on a game winner.I can't believe he made a 250 foot buzzer beater.Because he knew they would double him and he wanted a 1 on 1 with George.Using a screen is too easy for DameLol I'm so used him taking & making clutch shots like that in Staples that I ain't even surprised. Glad a lot of the East coast fans are getting to know Dame in way that fans of west coast teams have known him for a LONG time."Dame what are you doing dude go towards the basket or something you only have 3 sec-ohhhhhhhhhh i see"He 100% knew he was gonna make it, holy fuck.I legit thought he was watching the wrong clock or some shit when I saw it get under 3s. Then...KEETyEEberYes Yobe. Kobe‚Äôs dark cousinI subscribe to this timeline.‚õàüî´  Shhhhh. Just close your eyes. It's all over nowCurious question I have for Blazers fans. Which shot do you like more?No, we traded Gerald Wallace for the #6. If they had stayed healthy, we could have had Dame, Roy, Matthews, Batum, Aldridge, & Oden.I agree with this 100%, Dame just decided that the series was over, and then made it so.   There are maybe a handful of players in history that can make that happen in the way that he did tonight, he played 45+ minutes, scored 50 points, and CJ had to sit with foul trouble early and couldn't get in to rhythm in the second half. Dame won this game, obviously he couldn't have done it without the rest of his team, but I feel like there was no doubt in his mind that last shot was going in.  Amazing to witness.That's how he knew exactly where to shoot from. Fr though if that's not the big dick energy we all need idk what isBIG DICK DAMEHe walks into a room and his dicks already been there for five minutesThey're both pretty good. This ones more of a fuck you three the one against Houston was signature Dame Time  Edit: autocorrectThis easily tops it. The distance, the stakes and who he was being guarded by make this one of the coldest shots of all time.& the fact that it's just the perfect climax to his whole performance this seriesD A M E  T I M EAnd PG reacted immediatly. Crazy difficultI miss this meme[He knew what he was doing](https://i.imgur.com/dNg4pbb.jpg)[Im about to end this mans whole career](https://i.imgur.com/IgWgD4z.jpg)I want this tattoo‚Äôd on my faceShit looks like a Chappelle skit hahaThanks. Gonna post that any time I see a dumbass comment by anyone with an OKC flair.[Also his tender embrace with Kanter leading up to this](https://i.imgur.com/Fiy1kJA.jpg)[Shots, I take that.](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ofR3QioNy264/giphy.gif)Not just any 6‚Äô8 guy... fuckin‚Äô Paul George.Between GOT, Endgame and This shot killing Oklahoma. This week definitely have to be the week with the most casualty in human historyFuck the thunder. You cool tho.He waved everybody off and fucking sank that bitch Dame Called SeriesHonestly, if they had chosen to keep Harden instead of Westbrook, they'd easily be running the league the last 2-6 years.Best 0 in the NBASavage lvl 999LILLARD GOOD, GOOOOOOOD AND THE BLAZERS WIN THE SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 YEARS#GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODnot only that but it was a fucking step back, thats fucking insaneCold blooded OG shit right there. THE CLUTCHEST.when you put it like that holy shitSets franchise playoff three point record, eliminates team from playoffs, shot gets him to 50 points, does it from 40 feet, at the buzzer, fading away, against the 2nd best perimeter defender in the league. You couldn't write that any better.My wife went to bed about 10 minutes ago.   She thought I hurt myself because of how loud and primal I was screaming.My exact reaction laying down lmfaoNO OT TONIGHT#DAME TIMELILLARD TIME HAPPENEDNOTRE DAME HAPPENEDDAME TIME HAPPENEDAfter not saying a goddamn word for 3 games cause we saw what it looks like when Westbrook talks and realized we'd rather look like losers than mimic whatever that is.....I don't believe I can name a better time.That wave goodbye to OKC was fuckin gloriousFirst one was great, but this one was fucking incredible.I stood and cheered at this one. White Walker confirmedI agree, this one's better. Off the dribbleWhen it left his hands I knew that shit was gonna be cash money.Hell yeah. Huge comeback after getting a bit shafted by the refs for most of the 2nd half. Didnt complain but manned up. Instead of getting mad he simply passed it midair to an open man!Man I don‚Äôt know... this one was cold but that one in Houston they were down 2 and need the 3 and it was off an in bounds pass with defenders chasing him... both are nice but the degree of difficulty on that other one seems higher.Definitely a historic game.  Wtf dame.  How does he stay so calm after tho lol!!!! He didnt make any facial expression and just slowly walked away, I love that shit.  Straight killa50 points, buzzer beater, elimination maker. God fucking dammitIT'S FUCKING DAME TIME#I'm shitting myself!He‚Äôs a bad manThose 2 drives to the basket were so bad instead of moving the ball and let PG take the last 2 shots. PG missed 3 FTs.If you‚Äôre gonna go out, hard to beat going out on that noteOh it actually just clicked that both shots were on OKC...  ouch.Portland were probably fine with it going to OT since both Russ and PG had 5 foulsI used up all my disappointment after game 4 lolI was thinking why tf is he holding it so long and then fucking nearly fell out of my bedSo happy for y'all...what a fucking game for Dame...what a fucking shot.I won't miss those 15-0 runs from the opposing team and Billy sitting there with his arms folded.What else does one do with ass? Harvest it? Comb it? Store it for the winter? Those who know the way of the Holy Dame know that when an ass is lain before you you spread those cheeks and eat like the fountain of youth is on the other side. And it is. That's why people like Keanu and Nic Cage don't age. They are connoisuers of ass eating. And it shows.It's not like he finally arrived. It's like he gave the rest of the world a chance to wake up.I panicked. I saw the clock hit 3.8 and I was thinking WTF why are you not driving? Last play was a great drive to the rim and since Adams was on the bench, I was thinking drive again.Most underrated guard in the west.Those are all the feelings in the bar during that shot. We got a few ‚Äúwhy the- OHHHHHHH‚Äù to complete silence of disbelief. My fucking god that was so hype I am FLOOREDHe threw shade at the refs after the game saying something like   "I didn't want to drive and put the game in the refs hands"Yobe Keith- eerily similar to Toby Keith.Me too. I don't know who I would root for. I guess Portland, it's not a good idea to root against God.It‚Äôs not like he wants to do it.This one. The balls to take a contested 37 footer for the win. Holy hell!Holy shit, the lockout year with Raymond Felton.You guys are one of the most unlucky teams that somehow stays competitive in the post season year after year. Is the fo great? I never hear anything about it but the picks seem on point every time and there generally aren't any big splashes as far as trades. I'm a bit jealous, it almost seems like all of the super star teams will fade one year and all of the sudden the blazers will just be consistently killing it and snatch that ring. I would not be mad at that.Dame's career highlight reel is going to be fucking bananasThe Rockets one had the better call though.imo the houston one was harder to pull off and had higher stakes. Getting off a shot so quickly and having it go in is hardNobody I'd trust more than Dame during clutch time ‚åö‚åö‚åöIt's been a while since I've seen it used, it warms my heart.inject that face onto my facewho actually defended pretty well!Not just any Paul George... fuckin' Playoff PLove it. The way Russ and OKC laughed at him they deserved it. Big talk for one winEASILYYYY, Harden durant combo is disgustingHands fucking down dudeLol the half-court stepback in a tied elimination game at the buzzer. What the hellFrom the fucking logo#DAMETIMEIt‚Äôs the classiest, most disrespectful, most impressive shit I‚Äôve ever seenMy wife came running into the room to ask which dog got hurt.Now you just say  "It hurts all over baby.. kiss it and make it better"  Awww yeahI‚Äôm getting a noise complaint for sure LOL I screamed so loudNO GAME 5 IN 2 NIGHTSSO COLD I PUT ON A SWEATER IN MY OWN HOMEPlayoff P? More like Playoff Parsons.ONE OF THE MOST INSANE SHOTS IVE EVER SEENRight in PG's face tooSENT THE OKC PLAYOFF RUN UP IN FLAMESDame time?https://i.imgur.com/BawH8yt.gifBall game.Around a screen, at speed **and** off balance is no joke tbh.The Lord of Light-hearted locker room chemistry had something to say about thisit was just so cold too, right between PG's eyesHe just fuckin' knew it was gonna go in. That's range that I generally only trust Steph to make for a game winner... That's a soul-crushing and breath-taking shot both at the same time.Oh he had a smile on his face. It was subtle, but it was there.That must have felt so fucking good though when everyone rushed him screaming. That's the absolute pinnacle of sporting moments. You drain the perfect shot from almost half court to win the game and walk away feeling like a god.Dame Ethered the entire OKC team with that wave.MY PANTS HAVE EXPLODED AND I'M NOT EVEN A BLAZERS FANONE MORE TIME FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACKthose drives cemented the fact for me that russ does not have handles like the best of em. Obviously his explosiveness and euro step do a lot of work, but seeing him just stubbornly plow ahead to his right, no hesitations, crossovers, behind the back, etc, made him look a step below the best guys.Well. Its terrible cause I'll watch this buzzer beater for the rest of my life.   *que abandoned pet ads*I think thast why Dame also try to use as much time, and shot from far away so the clock expire, win-win situation, and he comes up with the BIG Whttps://i.imgur.com/PedE1EC.jpgAs soon as he launched it I was like no fucking way, then it went in. I went crazy, I had just tuned in with a minute to go with Blazers down 2. This shot gonna be remembered for a long time around hereSame, I'm pretty sure he planned it out though.  That was so much more badass than a layup.DONUTSJust him dicking teams down like thisHe flies under the radar but his shooting is honestly unreal. When he gets hot he's up there with Curry and KlayYeah and that was our first playoff series win for awhile, so it meant a lot to Blazer fans.Plus they were down by 2 so somehow even more clutchI mean, it's a fiction that's been dispelled once and for all.Yea he lunged and stretched out just as he saw Dame motioning for that step back. But damn, Dame's release point was clean.  Btw is anyone else bothered that Dwyane Wade's tweet was "Dame Damn" instead of "Damn Dame?". Lol‚ÄúHe got me,‚Äù Paul George said of Dame's logo-longshot over him. ‚ÄúThat fucking Damian boomed me.‚Äù PG added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so good,‚Äù repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Lillard to the list of players Russell Westbrook puts a hit on this summer.**37 FEET**Bruh, Dame, but it was our daughter lolNothing will make him nut harder than that shotI just sat here like "be dope if he made it...   Dope.... fuck this hurts"ENDGAME AND GOT TIMEI can't believe you've done this  Nah but for real with like 40 seconds left my roommate was saying it was shaping up really nicely for Dame to do that shit against someone else and bah God the mad man did itIt's the same timeLearning to be a fan of good games and not just the thunder is now completeAs soon as the clock got down to 5 or so and he was still at basically half court, I thought to myself that this dude is probably about to pull up from the logo and if he does, he is 100% going to make it because you have to be part cyborg to have the confidence to take a step-back buzzer-beating, 37-footer from the logo to win the series.If steph didnt exist, we might be talking about Dame as the best deep range threat in the NBAHis greatest strength is his passing man and his shooting is his weakness. He doesnt play to his strengths. I am a big fan of Westbrook but man he needs his game to do the talking more than his mouth and all his antics look childish now.You missed an incredible game and 4th quarter. That shot means so much more knowing they were down 15 with 6 minutes to go.I just fucking tuned in with a minute to go because I was in bed and had to see how it closed out...I fucking yelped when that went in lolIf anyone was going to stretch our anus I'm glad it was Dame.14 yearsTonight‚Äôs shot was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but that was 100% more emotional.That's the one thing that puts 2014's in the conversation. Down 2 with a road game 7 on the line. This one had OT as a fallback and 2 more games left. This was wayyy more fun though.Dame been drinking that Giant's milk.That twist to the pasta at the end was cooked perfectly its unfortunate it got buried so far but i wanna say you made me lol my friend.THIS WAS THE ENDGAMEAre we the same person?? Same shit with me man lmaoIf you guys had played anyone but us, I would have been rooting for you.Thanks, I was drawing a blank on how long it was!I will never in my life forget that shot.  The rest of my family isn't even big on basketball, but we all tuned in to watch game 6 and close things out.  Dad's hands on the remote to turn it off, 0.9 seconds left on the clock, 2 points down.. and he drains a 3. Everyone absolutely lost their fucking minds.The one he hits to win the finals is the biggest imo.    Remind me... 2 months.SUCKED ON THAT TEET FOR THREE MONTHS!Want to know why they call me the GiantsDame?Which one would you drink: Jordan‚Äôs secret stuff or Giants milk?WE IN THE DAME GAME NOWAND THE BLAZERS WIN THE SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR TEEN YEARS  Man I'm never gonna forget that callTHOUGHT I WAS A BABY!!!

RAPS CAN LOSE IN THE NBA FINALS NOW TO LEBRONDamn son. Chose family over legacy and can't respect it more. No coincidence he took the 4 yr deal that lasts throughout his son's HS tenure.   Edit: Ppl gotta remember that he grew up without a dad. He has titles. He has all the money he could ever need. But making his son happy prolly means the world to Lebron. He's doing this for his son. I'm okay with him teaming up somewhere for rings but why the lakers. Like the lakers need any more ringsBeen a Lakers fan since July 2018, you have no idea what this means to me. He goneThe East has absolutely no shot to win a title the next 5 years. Now all they need is Kawhi, Cousins, and some 3&D players and I can see the Warriors winning in 5Am I crazy or does this team without anyone else look like they're gonna get bounced in the first round? Lebron is Lebron, but this isn't like being in the East. I‚Äôm gay but nobody will see thisLeBron going to the Lakers just means he exits the playoffs one round earlier.Kuzma is tweeting a lot of welcoming stuff for Lebron, it would be hilarious if he was part of the package for the trade for Kawhi.holy fuck....warriors and houston in the finals.‚ÄúThey got me‚Äù LeBron said of the Lakers' signing. ‚ÄúThose f***ing Lakers signed me.‚Äù Lebron added, ‚ÄúThey're so rich,‚Äù repeating it four times.

Got it.Furiously deletes Lebron hating comments!This increased the Warriors chances at another championship, right?  They got a chance to knock LeBron out in the conference finals or semis now instead of the actual finals.  RIP LeagueI wanna meet the guy that probably bought a Cavs jersey when LeBron got drafted, then burned it when he went to Miami, then bought another one when he came back, then burns it again when he leavesthis is an AP reporter for the Cavaliers lol   Lakers bandwagon meets LeBron bandwagon. ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢Lakers fans gonna down vote but this really hurts his chances at catching MJs 6 rings unless Leonard is traded to LAI‚Äôve been a Cavs fan since early days growing up in the early 90s :  Good for him !

He wasn't happy[deleted]LeBron fucking ESPN again. Quick, Tim Teebow, do something newsworthy and the ESPN universe will collapse on itself.Not just showing the game, it's 9-0 in the sixth, and it's been garbage time since the 3rd. This is killing them. I can imagine epic profanity behind the scenes. Yeah I'm really interested how he's gonna fit in, but I expect to enjoy Sportscenter significantly less for at least a month and a halfNever underestimate their ability to suck both coasts‚Äô dicks at the same time.Yup.. I hope they were able to weather that drought.It's like the yankees. I hate this. so glad their suffering has ended and not at our expenseI am waiting for the day I could say that as a Knicks fan.

He then said he wanted to add withers to the list of reporters he would drop a bomb on in the future.My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when LeBron kept balance between the Eastern and the Western conference. But that all changed when the Lakers attacked.[deleted]If they die, they dieIM IN AWE...WOJ GOT BEAT TO THE PUNCH...LEBRON IS ACTUALLY IN LA!??!IVE BEEN A LAKER FAN SINCE JULY 2018 AND IM REALLY HAPPYThe fact it's soon makes you wonder if there's another domino lined up  in terms of player transactions/moves already ready to fall. Maybe not maybe this is truly just a family driven decision but still(edit).   Other possibility is LeBron wanted to do this as soon as possible so he could facilitate recruiting players/pushing the Lakers to make trades. Lot easier to get veterans to want to come for you for the minimum now at the beginning of FA than if you wait till most of them have already signed lol   Also the fact this is 4 years when LeBron has just done a ton of 1-2 year deals in the past is v interesting. Shows you how little faith he had in Dan Gilbert to pay that absurd tax bill otherwise unless he held leverage of potentially leaving. Because he's not doing that here. If there isn't already a big deal in place he's also clearly willing to trust LAL's FO that they will be willing to trade some of those young players for win now help and spend as much as it takes. There's a clear level of trust here that was never shown in Cleveland to that organizationThis kills the West Julius Randle yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Kyle Kuzma gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lonzo Ball belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the Staples Center door, ex-NBA star Kobe Bryant hugged him & said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different."And it worked out. He broke The Decision 3.An AP reporter huh. This could be the best or worst decision of his life.[deleted]I love how the top comment on that tweet  is:   ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre wrong, we‚Äôre taking your blue check homie.‚ÄùI'll be blacked out in 10 min so I'm commenting nowWithout a doubtI‚Äôm definitely getting one[deleted]At least Lakers fans can stop pretending to be Warriors fans nowWhere does the bandwagon line start?

I'm telling you that what the Lakers need is Gelo as the finisher!"This is the only saving grace here.

LeBron will run this team and will have none of that extra BS from Lavar Does this mean he‚Äôll wear BBB shoes?Big Bummer BrandYou know one requirement was them trading his ass lmaoI really am hoping he bullies Lavar until Lavar never shows his face in public againLeBron is gonna change Lavar's name to LeVarWatch him get traded back to an eastern team and prove you wrong.Big if trueAt least we have the Browns :,)Don't worry, Gilbert is looking forward to having his team back to rebuild.

WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDSI don't see Lebron signing with LA unless   a. he's certain they are bringing in more talent or   b. he just stopped caring altogether about winning and just wants to get endorsement money in LA.

Just went there for his familyWe know.I want to live in this timeline.Kevin Love, JR, TT, and George Hill beating LeBron in the Finals would truly be the weirdest thing that's ever happened in the NBA. If this happened I'd send Lue $5 in bitcoin.Headed by Kevin Love, abandoned by Kyrie and Lebron, who drops 30/9/10 on the way to a league MVP. Tyronn Lue makes a rousing halftime speech in Game 7 that inspires the team to dig out of a 12-point hole. The game ends with JR catching a Lebron missed free throw and throwing a 3/4 court shot to win the game. He turns to Lebron and says, ‚Äúwho forgot the score now?‚ÄùI think the last time ESPN interrupted a Yankees/Red Sox game was when they got Bin Laden. Tim Tebow announces that he is transitioning into Tina Tebow.He's actually doing pretty well in AA. I could see him getting up to AAA, hell if they tank he might even end up in the majors this year. If some crazy dumb shit were to happen, the Mets would be the ones to do it. And he's doing his job pretty damn well.Tim Tebow has decided to go back to school and play basketball for DukeIs that his golfing alter ego? Does he have others? Tim Skibow for his Alpine career? Keybow for NASCAR? LeBron steps into the arena, raises his hands, "let there be rain!." All of a sudden the heavens make a loud crack, the clouds part, and 10 years worth of rain fall at once, while Lakers fans fall to their knees and say how much they've always loved him.It was horrible. I didn't think I'd make it through.I hate it because of all the smug ass Lakers fans who spent 15 years acting like they deserved LeBron James. Talking about signing him or trading for him when it didn't make any damn sense.I wouldn't count on that.  Ask Raptors fans‚ÄúThat f***ing Withers boomed me‚Äù - WojSMH its cause the guy is balding and can't go to barber shops for the real dirtAnd Woj was the first unanimous MVS (most valuable source)Never forget the University of Virginia lost by 20 points in the first round as the number one overall seed.

Happy that I‚Äôm free from seeing my team losing to LeBron in the playoffs.Nope, Spurs have lost a lot of leverage now. First it was thought that without Kawhi/PG - LeBron is not getting near LA, so Spurs were trying to milk LA dry (as for LA that was basically trade for LeBron+Kawhi). Now it is straight swap and Spurs will (in the end) probably take the best offer, tho does LA have resources to make the best offer is whole another topicRip Cleveland fans.  :( Cleveland tank wagon if he wears 6 i want one... if he wears 23 i want one. if he wears 69 ill buy 2Is it thoThey can stop pretending to hate Lebron too.LA Convention Center is what I heard Aaaaaaan Lonzo gets traded to the Spurs for Kawhiit‚Äôs a possibility I hope they do.

ESPN would break away from The Decision to air that news.Wow, the coverage surrounding that would be insaneWith Skip Bayless leaving his wife for her. And Tina is having an abortion.    Would this vacuum be so great that all news ceases to ever be news?And signing with the Lakers.*AND with all the rain Los Angeles now also has lakes so the goddamn name makes sense again.Big props for sticking with them during those bleak times What bothers me is all the Lakers fans I know used to talk shit about LeBron, and now that he is a Laker they'll pretend that never happened.I get the feeling. Struggled so much for  those two grueling years. It still doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense. If they get reamed in a trade for Kawhi, or if they don‚Äôt make the trade, does anyone really think the Lakers can really compete with the Rockets or Warriors next year?Air Canada Centre died for this[deleted]clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game  ball is inbounded to Woj who turns face to face against Withers  "You took my bombs"  moves to the left  "You took my reputation"  moves to the right  "You took all that was dear to me"  clock winds down to 2  "I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS"  goes up, fire coming out of his shoes  "WOJORUKEN"  Ball flies over Wither‚Äôs head, goes straight into basket.

EDIT: I've had like 6 replies telling me to include Giannis. Fine, Beal's out.The PG influenceNo! This is \#NotMyWojBomb! Had my notifications for the wrong guy.AP showing Woj how it's done. Probably gonna hook a real woj bomb up to his car door.Woj never breaks LeBron news. I don't think Lebron's group likes himYep. Lebron being confident in where he wants to go, no matter who comes with him hurts the Spurs in negotiating. Only 2? pftI only hated LeBron because he wasn‚Äôt on the Lakers, now I can love him! I already got multiple texts from friends who are lakers fans who used to hate him... they riding him hard right now.Except all the Lebron stans will have Lakers flair nowEveryone + cash The Indians went to the World Series two years ago and Cleveland still prefers the BrownsHow many mortals It's better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved before.   edit: or at least since 1994It's a little easier watching NBA when you know your team sucks at least. No pressure. You can just enjoy basketball again, instead of agonizing over LeBron's legacy and Cleveland's failure every time he loses. Oh my god üòÇüòÇüòÇNational reporter Ramona Shelburne yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Long-time vet Shams Charania gave a look of pleasant surprise.  Brian Windhorst yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Withers hit the locker room door, former great Adrian Wojnarowski hugged him and said, ‚ÄúYou look so different.‚ÄùThis pasta knows no limitsLeBron will finally be on the other side of a finals sweep, it's almost poetic.Like, I'd be happy we atleast got the finals thoIt's been a good day for Toronto sports. You don't get it, we only suck balls against Daddy LeBronLeWipeNah, we gonna end up in the playoffs simply by the rest of the east doing a better job at suckingRumors say JR Smith is still playing game 15 in OracleCan't wait for when the Cavs play the Lakers and JR passes to LeBronJR gonna mistake Jeff Green for LebronI was driving!  https://i.imgur.com/bD3beAJ.jpgThat would be kinda hilarious but can you imagine Portland playing like Orlando or some shit in the first round? That jet lag travel time would be brutalDaddy?[deleted]Definitely. This just cleared the road for about 8 years of Sixers/Celtics ECFs. And if Kawhi goes to either of them, that'll be an arms race. I think the ceiling for the top teams in the east is lower but the cluster of teams at the top is bigger. That said, I'm still sticking with BOS/PHI for a good long while.Oh yeah, read that wrong. AP is about as credible as it gets, even among media institutions. Mans risked his entire livelihood to get us this tweet ten seconds early. It's real, Wow he beat Woj to itFor the sake of basketball in general, I'd vote to allow this.I'm holding it all inside. I'll wait.  **EDIT**: Wow, never really thought this would happen. Hope it goes well.god I want to believe this but at the same time I don't want to let myself downIt‚Äôs 2018 we here at r/nba are trying to be wholesome Ha. Gayee!Enjoy your honeymoon :)May as well kiss her dad's dickhttp://imgur.com/ucM4SfA*scoreboardThe Pope vs the Irish.  This gun be gud.Aren't you blowing it up?Yea no way the lakers get past the warriors. They're still just too stacked. Your telling me the team that won 3 out of the last 4 championships is the favorite?Hey that's actually a pretty sweet deal... (Oh no I'm too far gone)[deleted]So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance? Playoff P*Lamelo finally gets the max he deservesIt was #2 in their top 10.Maximum ratings boostFuck, my dumb ass thought you were talking about the name los angeles I acknowledge that I talked shit on LeBron. I'm conflicted lolIn the Hyperbolic Time ChamberOk, Semenpenis.with my bulls capLeBron's taking that king title pretty seriously.With cut ins to the WNBA developmental leaguelol dwyane wade is guaranteed that legacy all star vote nowDread it  Run from it  Withers arrives all the sameWoj boomed.I guess, but now it seems like the Lakers have to trade for Kawhi.  You gotta get someone for Lebron to play with to seriously compete with the top teams in the West.   But maybe that's why Cousins has been rumored. im so ready for that 2k19, bought to get nasty"Wtf I LOVE LeBron now"-lakers fansThe Cavs actually won a championship and Cleveland prefers the Browns. There's an alternate history somewhere where the Cavs never come back from 3-1 and the Indians defeat the Cubs and break the Cleveland sports curse. I wonder what the events of today are in that timeline.I live in SoCal and when the Kings and Ducks are doing great, people still prefers the tanking Lakers.*More*"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"  But I'm still crying :'(Cheap tickets at the Q!!This year will probably be my last year of watching Cleveland actually be half decent though. I'm slowly dying and I won't see another Cleveland championship. The doctors told me I'm slowly dying of old age and I only have another 60 years of life left. I guess having one championship is better than none :(you know the pasta is a banger when I upvote the ancillary "üòÇüòÇüòÇ" emojisI recognize this from the starter pack.I think I might give up basketball for competitive knitting at that point. LeBrown Stains [deleted]Holy fuck man.So you're saying the Magic will make the playoffs. Now my hopes are up.

Are you team Mufasa or Team Scar?Mr. Windhorst, I don‚Äôt feel so good...Perfectly balanced. As all NBA breaking news should be.A lot of people are only fans of their teams players. It‚Äôs not uncommon.So did the Monsters, even though it‚Äôs minor league, they still prefer the Browns. I upvote anyone who uses the word ancillary in a sentence.

My aunt dated a Max senior year at Columbia and used to talk about an underlying problem in their relationship, but never gave any details. She isn‚Äôt a sports fan and one day she came by the house early to drop off something and spotted Max on First Take about a month after he took the job. She started tearing up, and I looked at my dad with total confusion. She says, ‚Äúremember Max from Columbia? Look how far he‚Äôs come.‚Äù I was in shock and pressed her about why they broke up thinking I could have had an uncle Max. Turned out he was so worried about people hearing his farts, he used to poop standing up to make sure his farts wouldn‚Äôt echo off the toilet bowl. One night he drunkingly shit on my aunt‚Äôs jacket that was a WW2 family heirloom. She could never move past it.I can‚Äôt believe this is real. üòÇThis is the hardest i‚Äôve ever laughed at a reddit comment.Bro this comment has me fuckin dying.My dumbass thought you meant the country Columbia, I even checked his Wikipedia page to see it that was trueYou gotta suck it up with your sphincter and let it out a bit at a time.

It has the bottom text and everythingThat thousand yard stare right through Stephen A. üëÄNarrator: he did not hold it on this one day.r/nba is the greatest subreddit of all time and it's not even close  Man I've been laughing non stop, this is too goodThe most analyzed clip in recent history on r/NBA is about a dude failing to cover his fart and his lack of technique of farting in public.  Of all the time lines... This is one of themlolI feel like whatever cough he tried to do made it so much worseI thought i was doing okay, making it through all these comments, but this is the one that finally killed meLMAOOOOOO STOP3rd splash brother confirmed?I think that's Stephen really putting an emphasis on his letter p in "playing."The internet is ruthlessWe need ja, Where is ja rule !This should be the fart link sent everytime someone has stupid ASSumptionsHoly shit 1 hour old 18.7k upvotes   Platinum x1, gold x7, and silver x6  This might be the fastest anything has got to #1 on r/allPoor Molly.Now I'm salty, I literally watched that video a few hours before this post and totally missed the fart.

Do better nephewOn the one hand I wanna empathize with him because we‚Äôve all kinda been there before and it sucks, but as a fan of a certain team and player that Kellerman just loves to shit on (hah), I hope he continues to suffer this, climaxing in a live, on-air pooping of his pantsNot even, if it‚Äôs coming out that fast n‚Äô furious he ate something 30 mins earlier that wanted to make a quick exit, like Magic Johnson dippin‚Äô out his bunghole.In the midst of the playoffs this is the content I care most aboutIsn't it Molly agreeing to SAS?Lol you guys are idiots, that was the woman making a vocal sound, sounds like shes say "mmm" or "mhmm" in response to what buddy is saying.I once worked out next to this fine ass cutie using the  assisted chin up machine (the one you put your knees on then lift yourself into your sets) while I was curling some free weights just beside it.  Well whatever she was jamming in those headphones was maxed to the volume and/or must not have realized how audible she was as she proceeded to squeeze out three relatively high pitched squirt-farts each time she peaked out at the top of her chin up.BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP  snnnnniiiiiiffffffffffff...oh yes my dear....sssnnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiffffffff....quite pungent indeed...is that....dare I say....sssssssnniff...eggs I smell?......sniff sniff....hmmm...yes...quite so my darling....sniff....quite pungent eggs yes very much so .....ssssssssssssssnnnnnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiffffff....ah yes...and also....a hint of....sniff....cheese.....quite wet my dear....sniff...but of yes...this will do nicely....sniff.....please my dear....another if you please....nice a big now....

That way your cheeks dont clap and the fart makes no noise.Personally, I‚Äôve mastered the push and pull timing of my farts. I push it to the surface, suck it back in, and let it slowly ease out silently. Works 99% of the time, that 1% though...Poor Max. I didn‚Äôt know who the guy was prior to watching this video so all I know about him is that he farted twice live on air today.this nigga eating beansBruh ü§£ü§£‚ò†Ô∏èwait, you‚Äôre OP.  now you‚Äôre saying he didn‚Äôt fart?Poor guy.https://i.imgur.com/vdFUjys.jpgTHE LOB.

You know his eyes would get so wide and eye brows so high while he nodded his head up and down on those last 3 words"But we're missing the bigger picture here, *pfffrrrrrt* because when PLAYERS are in control of their contracts, *brrrrrrrrttturturrrt* then the building of the SUPER-TEAM, *prrt-ptt-prrrrrt* is wholly dependent on 2 things: market size, *burrrt-burrt-burrrrt* and cap space."When you shit yourself in class and try to calm the backlashIt's wonderful when a fresh meme is bornMax out here about to become the new [Kornheiser](https://images.cdn.circlesix.co/image/1/700/0/uploads/posts/2017/03/72df22835b5a235ebefcc38a7de74763.jpg)Memes are becoming self aware.

Everyone hates skip and SASWait what‚Äôs the hate for Max?Is the take that Max is hated? I only know him from LA radio a few years ago and I thought he was hilarious. (Full of himself, but hilarious, that is.)I like Max Kellerman.I want a bidet but don‚Äôt know if I want cold water on my b hole.   ...do I want cold water on my b hole?I bet that guy has shit slicks.

I feel great when I take one of those shits that there isn‚Äôt anything left over.Nephews out here not knowing about YaBoiBeefCat.Olive Garden breadsticks please.Al denteI know this is gonna get buried, but I genuinely enjoyed Max when he first came on the show. Sure, he's kinda dopey and isn't the strongest analyst, but he seemed like a relatable dude. I've been studying for sports journalism, and one of my guilty pleasures was watching Max and the other guys go back and forth with each other. I was usually able to watch the whole show since I was at home when my parents were at work. After a few months, though, my dad came home early one day and walked in on me laughing at one of their dumb jokes. Without saying a word, he stormed out of the living room. Thirty seconds later, he stormed back inside, turned off the TV, and beat the crap out of me with a pair of jumper cables.YesIt‚Äôs real. I dated Max in college as wellIt‚Äôs real. I am that WW2 family heirloom.poop on the celticsPretty sure it isthat's definitely a woman saying "mhm"Every time I think it's okay to trust a Kings fan,they do something like thisbro what the fuck is thisThanks I hate itcould we notYes, FBI, this post right here/r/BRAPThis damn video has had me in tears for the past few minutes, great job OP.Yoooo I am laughing so hard I almost threw up.

Probably missed the timing and couldnt push out, didnt want to be doing the fart lean for so long in public and gave up.Your cheeks don‚Äôt slap together to make the noise. It‚Äôs the little crevices in your butthole that air slips through right?  Can a scientist assist us here?Yeah... I'm going to need a diagram.Thanks for the advice.

We all like maxThe one I have has temperature control, but I'm renting and don't want to drill a hole in the side of my cabinets to get to the hot water. So there are ones out there for you.honestly, it doesnt feel as bad as youd expect. since its so localized, like turn your faucet cold and put one finger under it. the finger feels it, but ur hand doesnt feel that cold. it really aint that bad.Nephews for a reason.more Alfredo sauce, please.Our condolencesConfirmed. Source: I just farted.Honestly, this makes me feel better about high school farts. Yeah I may have tooted a couple of times while asleep in class, but I‚Äôve never tooted on national television. Thanks OP and thanks Max.It's my greatest contribution to humanity so far. I added up the numbers at one point between the original video and all the stolen copies, and humanity as a whole has spent more than 300 years listening to me fart.That was some ocarina of time farting right there, holy shit I'm crying laughingIt's brought so much joy to the world, I feel like it's got a life of its own now.It‚Äôs been a good while since I‚Äôve laughed at something so hard. So glad I‚Äôve been blessed with listening to this beautiful masterpiece.I'm dead and alive at the same timeI dunno what it is, that fart is such a universal ambassador of goodwill.I have legit signed autographs in three different countries because of this fart.This makes it all worthwhile. :)If it makes you feel better I'm 42.Love me some NBA!The trick is to make sure you don‚Äôt clench. That‚Äôs a classic one cheek squeaker, definitely less than ideal in front of microphonesThose also get spread out. They're both responsible for the noise I think. Loosen everything too. Tightening it might make a noise.As a booty scientist, I can tell you that in my educated opinion if you never tried to slip a Hiawathan lean-poo and felt your ass cheeks clappin, then you ain‚Äôt got no ass[I'm no artist but](https://imgur.com/a/IgAL0UA)I can‚Äôt believe this is the 2nd most upvoted post on this subSportsNation Max was great too, He is just held back by First Take.HAHA!

Why/how did you get such a high quality recording of a musical fart like that?I was in a period of my life when I recorded all my farts on my phone to send to my brother. He'd moved out of town and I didn't want him to feel homesick.  I'm still in that period, but I was then, too.

Sent the rim to BelizeSee y'all same place, same time next year.It can only be surpassed by Lebron throwing curry off the backboard and dunking him2 years in a row lolI‚Äôm commenting just to say I saw it liveJust like last years, yes it will. Sadly this might be the one good thing we remember from the cavs this series. signed into my alt-porn account to upvote this twice.To the topAs in tradition As is traditionI cannot believe he pulled this out in back to back Finalsit's playground basketball boysWhen he went under i was like "where the fuck is he going"   and then i found outShit is too easy to him *Russell Westbrook likes this post*Does that count as a rebound? Also if he threw it off the backboard to someone else do they get a rebound and he get an assist?When you have 4 bums so you gotta pass and score by yourselfNeeds that extra rebound smh.they should give him an assist for that one One of each lmao. How do they score that? Just one rebound and two points.Lmao LeBron remembered he did it last year and said fuck it let me try againLeGradyHe cant keep getting away with thisToo bad he‚Äôs not active on Ig. Cuz thats a #WelcomeToSeason15 post"HOW MY NUTS TASTE!?"not even the most emphatic dunk of the season for LBJMy penis is out Oh yesit literally just came out of me lmao I had no control over itAll of the Buffalo Wild Wings I'm atIt's 3 am in europe, LeBron gonna get me evicted with his shitI made noises. I just woke the babies downstairs up, and I don't FUCKING CAREWe live in a societyI remember when he was like, top draft pick or something and everyone was screaming about how he was overhyped. He has united us all. Dread it. Run from it. LeSelfAlleyOop arrives all the same.LeBalanced LeThrowitoffthebackboardOne missed field goal one madeKD's momma so fat he had to snap twice thoSomeone needs to make a gif where all the GSW players turn to dust when he lands the dunk.disgusting.https://youtu.be/_yWFdmGfM0s  I guess he did it a lot since they made a top ten videothis is literally the top comment from last years playYesi believe it is, because he establishes his left as his pivot foot and then steps and jumps off his right foot while simultaneously taking his left foot, his pivot foot, off the ground.I don‚Äôt know how people are being upvoted for saying yes.  In every level of basketball‚Äôs rulebooks, it will say that you can lift your pivot foot in order to shoot or pass.  That‚Äôs what he did.  That‚Äôs what dirk does on his one foot fadeaways.  It‚Äôs what every great big man does on up and unders.  It‚Äôs how the eurostep works.  It‚Äôs actually how any regular layup works if you slowed it downI don't follow basketball, but glad I'm not the only one that saw a pivot then travel.  Last time I commented on /r/nba was when I saw Lebron up-and-down/travel, but most said no, until we got an HD/view of images... Foot was back down on the ground with ball in hand.  Probably why I don't follow basketball. All-Stars are given different rules more so than other sports imho. Watching ESPN the other day I heard Stephen A. Smith say "You can't call that on Lebron James" WTF? How about, you can't call that on anybody? Maybe thats what he meant, but watching the game from the outside, its how I see it.ThereLearned it from TMacThese mother fuckers weren't old enough to stay up and watch basketball when Kobe and tmac were doing this shit. I scrolled down looking for this comment.  While the dunk from lebron was nasty and i damn near jumped out my seat, Kobe and T\-Mac were on plenty of highlight reels doing passes of the backboard.  I do recall one video (cant remember the game or if he was on heat/cavs) where lebron tried it and traveled.  And as crazy as it sounds, the refs aactually called it.I‚Äôm over here thinking ‚ÄúI hope he called KOBE!‚Äù During the play.  This sub is mostly lebron loving childrenOwieEvery man in the crowd got triplets This is the 2nd one of these in the finals he has pulled off.Didn't Kobe do a ton of these in his career?Because of a self oop?[deleted]Dude did this exact same play last year. fucking CYBORG Kobe been did this like a dozen timesA few people have done this before like Kobe and T-Mac are the first I remember doing itAh fuckI have some bad news...Came here to say that. Gotta jump off two right? Stepped through. Because people like lebron better than kdLike LeBronto?Leveland.CleBronLolGood point....that‚Äôll cause a bit of confusion.

I swear it was here before I saw it on TVDeservedlyI‚Äôm just here to be rememberedCan‚Äôt wait for Lebron to get robotic enhancements Commenting to be part of historySame place, same time, and a 5 superstar Cavs team somehow yeah sure sounds good !I WAS THEREAyo fam, we next.He did something real similar in game 3 last year right?I‚Äôd like to be a part of history as wellLebron does it again!Here for history!remindme 1 yearAs per traditionRemindme! 365 days  That gave me a good chuckle when I really needed one, thanks :)This year was somehow even more impressiveThis one was sooooo much more calculated though like wtf BronIt's just the same series over and over again.saw it live srysrysryI turned the game on with 4 seconds on the shot clock.  I lead a good lifeI'm commenting just to say I saw it hereNah this LeBron looks better than last year.

We NBA Street nowI once was lost but now I'm found  Was blind but now I see  LEBRON JAMES BITCH! yeah I thought he was taking a page out of Clarkson's book and was about to pull up for an atrocious jumper*Paul George will remember that*Especially the missed shot partJVG (or another com) said missed shot, rebound, made shot Feel like it isn‚Äôt a shot attempt and shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one. I think the most accurate scoring would just be the 2 points. I don‚Äôt think it should be a missed shot and a rebound It really should count as an assist. Not a shot and rebound. I think his stat line is gonna be ok without itIt was clearly a self pass. I think it's just 2 points. Stylish ass field goal but still just a field goal lol [off the backboard dunk from last years finals] (https://streamable.com/irt37)I'm waiting for the LeYear20 memes in the future with people saying he can't keep getting away with this.This man is not human lmao.LEBRON LET HIS NUTS HANG   Damn that‚Äôs what my mom said when I was bornI‚Äôm in a coffee shop and i  yelled out loud and then very awkwardly apologized to the room *bottom text*Can't stand ya!Jerk store.

Technically, yes. But I've seen about four travels so far this game. They don't ever call it. [deleted][From NBA.com](http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_10.html): >  If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor. If he drops the ball while in the air, he may not be the first to touch the ball.  If I'm reading this correctly, I don't think it's a travel.It's awesome how many people watch this sport that have zero clue what the rules actually are.  Your pivot foot can leave the ground, as long as you shoot before it touches the ground again, which he does without a problem. You can also catch your own pass/shot as long as it hits the backboard.  No travel here at all.> can lift your pivot foot in order to shoot or pass.  Sure.    But you can't lift your pivot foot, step onto your other foot, and then jump off that foot. Except that wasn't actually a travel lol.GoesTmac the god. Tmac enjoyed sleeping as a hobby. Ball by day, sleep after 5pm.Yeah but this is in the Finals against the Warriors so it has a little extra somethin somethinhttps://youtu.be/jVwOD4BbtmYr/warriorhurtingjuiceOuchThis is the 2nd one of these in the finals he has pulled off *so far.*[deleted]I mean there a top post on r/all where jordan dunks a missed free throw from pippenNah I‚Äôm still here   Edit: damn boys we went from +5 to -9 to +4 in the span of a few minutes. Obviously lebron is the greatest player atm but are we not allowed to have opinions on subjective matters such as ‚Äúfun to watch?‚Äù [removed][deleted]You can lift up the pivot foot as long as it's for a shot or a pass.  It's easily searchable on the online version of the rulebook if you're interest and/or don't believe me It's honestly ridiculous. It was a good dunk, but nowhere near top post of all time worthy. KD's shot would be far more worthy of that.

I know it would be a rebound + pointsLeSnapFor the millionth time here people: YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LIFT YOUR PIVOT FOOT if you are going up for a shot or pass and do so before one of your feet touch the ground.  EDIT: To be more specific the rule is you only have to do so before your **pivot foot** touches the ground again, rules linked in my post below.But you‚Äôre allowed to lift your pivot foot... it‚Äôs how every Dirk fadeaway works.  You can lift your pivot foot as long as it‚Äôs into a shot or passYou are reading it correctly.  And it‚Äôs not just an nba rule, that‚Äôs how all levels of basketball works.  Watch Dirk play.  His fadeaways always have him lifting his pivot foot.  Look at any up and under from the great big men.  You can lift your pivot foot to shoot Yeah, you are allowed to jump lol.

A few years ago, people were talking about when LeBron's prime would end. It turns out that he wasn't even in his prime yet, because he's only gotten better each year since then. For all we know, he *still* might not even be in his best form.Yes.   Arguments will be made that *championships ~ greatness* and so Jordan is the greatest: but Lebron is without a doubt the **best** basketball player to have ever played the game.   Not only is he a physical specimen the likes of which we've never witnessed, but his combination  of scoring ability, passing ability, speed, basketball IQ, physical presence, leadership and court vision is simply unmatched in the annals of professional basketball. Everybody buckle up! This one's about to take off!i made itWe're all in this together LeBron is the reverse of dog years. It‚Äôs lebron years. By age 46 he will reach his primeI wontyea, hes basically playing the western all-star starters too_Melo used Rock Throw. The attack missed!_Assist from James to James! That's what the other commentator said. Understandable Is JVG the real bald fraud r/soccer?Backboar might reset possession.  Did some searching and   > addition to contact with other players, contact with the rim or backboard can be used as a means of recovering your own pass. This form of self-passing is often used at the end of a fast break, typically as part of an acrobatic layup or slam-dunk attempt.¬†    So it's just 2 points, no assist or missed shot.I think it's just a pass. Same as if you bounced it off another player. Just lack of possession by any playerHmmm touch√©. Missed shot it isReally I was just about to say I prefer this year's lol.I personally prefer this years' but him dunking over an opponent and his own teammate last year was NICEThe pass was better last year, the dunk was better this year.I like the casual, underhand toss in mid air from last year'sHis left foot was his pivot foot, he lifted it and then he put his right foot down before releasing the ball.   Travel  EDIT: His left foot was established pivot foot as he lifted his right foot in the air. He then plants his right foot, and then he lifts he left foot, which was his established pivot foot, before releasing the ball.

It does not become a travel until the pivot foot touches the ground NOT when it leaves the ground. The NBA changed their rule for what a travel is like 10 years ago.

S/O to all you strong independent men in here freely expressing your emotions.  r/all here, I've never been into NBA but used to watch college ball. Could a kind soul tell me what happened?This is such a beautiful fucking moment for the NBA.I hope everyone who called it sad when that video leaked of drose hooping with some kid in a high school gym sees this. And watches his highlights from this game. That was him putting in work, like he‚Äôs always done, for moments like this. SHOUT OUT DROSE man I love Drose, wish nothing but the best for him My costume this Halloween is Man Crying Watching NBA Games Alone In His RoomDerrick Rose: **YOU FUCKING NEED ME**IM CRYINGThis was seriously one of the best basketball moments I‚Äôve witnessed in the club, cryingso awesome to see these guys get behind Rose like that and support him!! and its even better to see how much this performance meant to him, truly inspirational stuff Man that made me too emotional WE LOVE YOU ROSEDamn I‚Äôm cryin We‚Äôre not even a month into the season and I‚Äôve been reduced to tears on a Wednesday. I love it. Gotta feel amazing after all he's been through. Most would've given up by nowI can't put into words how fucking happy I am to see him ball out This is the happiest moment for Bulls fans in at least 5 years. I just lost my shit. I wasn‚Äôt ready for this wtfDamn I cried too.  I'm so happy for Derrick.Time to get rid of Jimmy boys.   That team looked so much happier and motivated to play basketball tonight.  Just trade the man.Ok I'm legit crying right now.  I'm gonna tell you my Derrick Rose story.  I moved to Chicago in 2010, my last favorite team was the Huston Rockets in the Yao era, which was so far away that I felt a disconnect even though they were putting up nice numbers.  Derrick Rose gets drafted in 2008, won rookie of the year, had a break out year 2009-10 season. Then here I was, in the windy city, watching my first Bulls game on TV, and Derrick Rose's moves perpetually made me a Bulls fan for live. I was so convinced that he might be the most talented point guard in the history of NBA, if anyone argues with me, I would go bonkers.  After a few years of ups and downs, Derrick Rose hits the famous buzzer beater against the Cavs at United Center, that was the most exciting feeling I have ever felt in my life, ever, although LeBron shot them down the next game, it was amazing.  Derrick Rose got traded to the Knicks, the Old Bulls fell apart, Jimmy Butler became the alpha and the Chicago Favorite, and every Rose #1 Bulls jersey in the city has disappeared. I felt sad, but I understand how much of a toll the injuries have taken on Derrick Rose, and I just wished him to have a healthy career on the Knicks.  Of course he didn't then he moved to the Cavs, then the whole Cavs trading fiasco happened, than he got waived by the Jazz, I felt extremely sad. Is this really the end for the Windy City Assassin?  Fast forward to tonight, he hits threes, he drives to the lane, he passes the ball like White Chocolate, he got 50 points. Career high, at the Timberwolves, in Minnesota.  I am crying. The haters do not understand the struggles he went through.  When he left the team in the Knicks, I was probably the only few guys defending him on the internet, I got buried in downvotes.  This season, I can feel his energy everytime he steps on the floor. He is on a mission, and is not just coasting for a 10/5/5 stat, but to prove himself to the world that although he might be forgotten, he has not lost his love for Basketball.  Drive home safe Chicago, the Derrick Rose you love has never left.  &#x200B;get that postgame interview upESPN tomorrow ‚ÄúRose drops 50, what does this mean for LeBron and the Lakers.‚Äù  In all seriousness, as a Rose fan from the beginning this is amazing. Congrats to him, an amazing performance!Pissing tears right nowI‚Äôm happy for him even though we lost. I‚Äôm so happy for this guy. Bro this is amazing let's do this WolvesDerrick Rose is the reason I became a fan of the NBA, and he‚Äôs still my favorite player. Makes me so happy to see him ball out For someone undergoing depression like me, this redemption game by Rose makes it so satisfying to watch.I remember someone on this sub telling the story about Derrick Rose insisting he was no longer ‚Äúthe man‚Äù anymore after a fan yelled out to him that he was ‚Äúthe man.‚Äù   Tonight, there‚Äôs no doubt he was ‚Äúthe man,‚Äù and I hope he feels that.As Derrick Rose makes the game winning block, all the team's internal rift goes away. Jimmy Butler stays with the team. The team develops great chemistry and goes on to have a great season. Through a tough season they eventually make it to the NBA Finals. During game 7 of the finals, Derrick Rose makes one of his signature layups to win the series at the buzzer.... giving the Timberwolves their first NBA championship. [Derrick Rose shows up in his Halloween costume](http://www.dmfashionbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/derrickrose.jpg) *All that is gold does not glitter,*  *Not all those who wander are lost;*  *The old that is strong does not wither,*  *Deep roots are not reached by the frost.*  *From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,*  *A light from the shadows shall spring;*  *Renewed shall be blade that was broken,*  *The crownless again shall be king.*Fuck off jimmy. At least these guys care about and respect each other.I‚Äôm crying rn Y‚Äôall gotta get rid of JimmyReal men cry üò≠As just another kid from Chicago. I fucking love you Derrick. Please promise to retire as a Bull when you hang it up for good üò≠So this post is at the front page now so figured I'd give some context to why this is so highly upvoted and what it means to D.Rose and us fans of him and basketball as whole.  &#x200B;  D.Rose played most of his career for the Chicago Bulls drafted first overall of the 2008 draft, in his first year, it was clear he was going to be a superstar(like most 1st overall picks). In his second year, he made all star team and further established himself as a force in the league. Now comes his third year which was the best year of his career, he won MVP and carried the bulls to the eastern conference final against the heat where he lost again Lebron, Wade and Bosh aka the superteam of that time(think the warriors right now). Anyhow, at that moment there was no one seen as better than D Rose in the entire league except Lebron(obviously a top 5 player of all time). The sky was the limit for Rose at this point, personally that's when I started watching basketball. He's my favorite player of all time despite me cheering for all boston teams in all sports.   &#x200B;  Here comes the 4th year, after a good season, the bulls play the 76ers in the first round and in the first game, it happened. D Rose teared his acl after not landing properly. He didn't play the whole next year because of the injury, and when he came back the year after he got injured again and didn't play for a long time once again. This is the downfall of a player that was gonna dominate the game, he never been able to recover, he got traded to the knicks and then signed with cavs for peanuts. Nothing worked, he has been confined to a bench role, most thought he was done playing basketball, the injuries killed him.  &#x200B;  Fast forward, this summer, he signs a small contract with the wolves to sign with his old bulls coach(which is a meme because a lot of old bulls players got signed there with Thibodeau) who now is the coach and gm of the wolves. Anyhow, the season just started and D Rose has been very good so far in every game(except the last I think not 100% sure). Anyhow, today he got to start because Teague(point guard) got injured monday. We got to see old D Rose drop a 50 points game, he hadn't scored 40+ points since 2011 to give you an idea of what he accomplished today. Everyone was chanting MVP during the game, this was such a special moment for the love of the game. Honestly, I would love for him to have a huge year, he never gave up and he deserves some redemption after all the bad luck he's had.   &#x200B;  Hoping for 2019 MVP D Rose, get em!Why am I crying in the club rn?Fine. I‚Äôm crying a fucking river.Couldn't be happier for him. this is one of the best moments ive seen in my years of watching the sportI‚Äôm a bit too emotional right now.Guys this doesn't even show the most emotional part!!! He was already in tears while the game was still going. He came out of the last time out with tears streaming down his face and was wiping away tears as he was playing defense on the final Jazz possession. HE WAS ALREADY IN TEARS WHEN HE MADE THAT FINAL BLOCK!  Seriously touching, heartwarming, emotional, amazing.... and any other adjective you can think of.Fuck jimmy butler Sports rarely ever does this to me, but imma have an extra spring to my step tomorrow after watching this.Young Teague getting matched against MVP Rose in the playoffs and playing well was his ‚Äúwelcome to the NBA‚Äù moment. It‚Äôs weird seeing him supporting Rose kind of like an older brother now. But a cool scene.Day One Drose fan inb4 the band wagoners come back.Man I'm so happy for him, he's been through so much. If he never got injured he would be one of the best players in the NBA still.We were robbed of this man's prime! Right up there with Penny and Hill as the most unfortunate careers derailed by injuries. He's got to be feeling like the king of the world now. This made me feel good.Fuck yes. FUCK YES.  &#x200B;  The Legend Lives On. His teammates surrounding him plus the postgame interview. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this kind of emotion üò≠As a person who doesn't watch basketball, what's the context behind this?I LOVE THIS TEAM!I don‚Äôt even care that the Bulls lost, this brought me so much happiness. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better end to my night than watching Drose ball the fuck outI know it's corny to say, but moments like this are why I love basketball, and sports in general. Amazing to see.And all this amidst Butler taking off for selfish reasons when he's healthy and no one having the guts to stand up to him.  You have Rose out there who is the epitome of hard work crying bc of how much he loves this game and what it's meant to him.  Butler should be ashamed.  I remember when Rose got hurt in the playoffs I was pleading it not to be the case bc of how awesome he was and how that team was going to challenge the Heat.  And I am a Sixers fan who saw my 8th-seeded team advance bc of that injury.Fuck lol tearing upMama there goes that manNow I‚Äôm crying.BALLS TO THE WALL  I was crying while watching him cry T_TI've never been so happy for a player I‚Äôm crying bro I don‚Äôt care what team you cheer for, as a basketball fan, this moment has to make you feel good. I‚Äôve been such a huge D Rose fan since he first came into the league, and I‚Äôve been very saddened by the internet trolls calling for his retirement the last few seasons.  This man has lost so much, yet continues to work hard, play hard, and live his dream. KEEP BALLING, D üåπ‚ù§Ô∏èIt was so stressful seeing Utah get a THIRD try to tie the game, but DRose got the game winning block fking amazing NBA scriptwriters manThis post has 9 gold already man people love Drose[deleted]The announcers were talking about off the court issues he is dealing with, is this related to the court case he had like 3 years ago on the Knicks or is there something new?Build the statue!I'm legit tearing up for this guy, this performance exemplifies what the NBA is all about.I can't put it into words to describe just how HAPPY I am. I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING!Who is cutting onions near me damn it.THATS MY MVPThat's my MVPThe game Derrick Rose had tonight was spookyThis is itSHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSEI got some new D-Rose highlights to watch tonight boysüò≠ So happy for this beautiful man.For all the drama surrounding Minny this year, this moment was a joy to witness. Fuck Jimmy Butler for not being there for this TEAM effort Man what a emotional night for wolves and rose. They are so deserving this W. Also fuck Jimmy Buckets. Thats how you lead young guys jim not humiliating them. Fuck outta here with your general soreness.Big time players make big time plays!D. Rose üåπ forever Is Tolliver in every team in the NBA simultaneously? Maybe Drose was on the practice squad that beat the first string. No wonder why Jimmy‚Äôs team won... Drose is still a baller!!Rose was always Your father, you just didn't know it until now.Ship out Jimmy. Trade Teague. Let's go.There used to be a greying logo alone on the court. You became the light on the west side of Chi. Ball remained a drug that's the high and not the pill.

[deleted]I cried when he got injured, and I'm crying now.  I love this guy. üåπüåπüåπüåπTHATS MY MVP!üåπüåπüåπüåπI remember watching him during the 2011 playoffs and wanting him to win so badly. I loved his game and really been rooting for him in the past 7 years. Hope he can continue this onslaught and prove the haters wrong! Man this brings me back as a kid watching his MVP season, I will always cheer for Drose no matter whatAs a fan of basketball, i need this guy to succeedShedding real tears rn. I love Derrick Rose so much man Well, the guy is an MVP. What an awesome night for D-Rose.Me too. Amazing.   I really hope people understand how hard he worked. Nobody wanted to sign him last year, he spent a month working out in a completely empty Cleveland state gym just to try to get back. After Thibs signed him everybody shat on him, he was honestly our 2nd best player vs HoustonCavs fans should‚Äôve known that losing our former MVP was going to hurt us.   Yeah, also that LeBron guy too Longest span between MVP awards incoming. The man is on a mission, and I am supporting him all the way. Bless his knees!Truer words have never been spokenAt least move Teague to the benchEspecially with the KG era jerseys on Maybe instead of ‚Äúy‚Äôall needing‚Äù Jimmy Butler, y‚Äôall needed each other‚Äôs friendship all along   Fuck man we don't want Butler is Rose available?They gotta trade Jimmy asap This is exactly what the team needs to get chemistry back on track I‚Äôm just happy my guy D-Rose is backüò≠ Although he never left These guys actually looked like they were having fun tonightI think the Wolves dysfunction is mostly (if not all) related to Jimmy. Teague was cheering for Rose like crazy tonight even though he might lose some minutes to him.I dreamed of this back in 2011. Vintage Rose!I think we all canFuck Jimmy ButlerRemember last year when some clown ass reporter made fun of him for shooting hoops alone in a gym near Cleveland? Bet they feel pretty dumb right nowCan't help but root for the guySame, I didn't want to lose, but happy to see D.Rose perform at that levelFirst Kobe now Rose. I finna expect to cry every time I watch Jazz games nowUTAH JAZZ LEGENDThis is the most wholesome NBA timelineWhat's he been through? I don't know much about basketball, I'm from /r/allThe dude I‚Äôm up against in fantasy has him and I couldn‚Äôt care less I just kept yelling at d rose to go get em. I‚Äôm a sucker for a comeback story and this guy deserves it more than most. He‚Äôll never truly have a comeback but moments like this mean so much to him and his fans. Love this dude Vsing D.Rose in fantasy, and ive never been happier with a player dropping 50 on my head. Respect to the Jazz. This game is much bigger since it was against a strong team like the Jazz that isn't pulling any punches. It makes Rose's game that much more special.   An adversary you can respect. Not gonna lie I almost shed a tear watching him cry. Rose got a lot of heart.Hes spent countless hours in rehab and probably countless nights in bed laying awake wonderin if he was still good enough to play. He was awesome tonight awesome moment.I‚Äôm gonna sleep like a baby tonight. Man, me too.me too man, gotta go back and watch the video where Rose goes to China and meet all his fans still cheering for him back from a few years ago.Same no shame all I wanted to see him keep prove to people he couldn't hack it anymore something about seeing this just brings out pure joy in me he deserves it it made me tear up seeing his reaction and everythingI am not even Rose's fan and I got a bit emotional too. Where amazing happens.If you didn‚Äôt cry watching that interview then you don‚Äôt like NBA basketball Anyone who rooted for him and watched his fall is a bit emotional.    Watched this 5 times in a loop and came here to comment and to go back and watch again.   Hes amazing and the body fails but his will didn't.  Though honestly this year I've seen a bit of that old Rose back.   We all didHe's had to go through so much more than most players, and he's plays harder than so many other players. Love seeing him succeed like this. Oh I cried Im smiling also crying at the same time. is it normal?This needs it's own postShit got me in tears.  There's no better feeling than finally succeeding at something and proving everyone that talked shit about you wrong. Especially, after everyone feels you fell off and especially if/when it's supporting someone else.  It builds a different kind of fire in you and every time you succeed, you're in tears because you remember where you came from during those lows. I've been there (not as an athlete though)."I worked my ass off". I was at the game. Incredible and powerful moment. Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barbershop. D-Rose can‚Äôt shoot 3s, D-Rose fucked his knees. My boy weak, he got no game no more or something. He, he say that boy ain‚Äôt been putting in work. SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about D-Rose ain‚Äôt no hitter, D-Rose a wash, D-Rose a fake SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt live with that boy! You know that boy got that MVP pedigree, too big too strong and shit. D-Rose been pullin up since fucking.... I don‚Äôt know when. Motherfuckers stop fucking playin him like that. Them boys ballin out here. If I catch another Knick or Big Baller Ass Laker motherfucker talking sweet about Rose I‚Äôm beating they fucking ass! I‚Äôm not fucking playing no more, you know those boys roll with Thibs and them!you and the entirety of fucking Chicago, man. An absolute storybook situation, kid from the streets gets drafted by his hometown Bulls and he lights up the NBA with his ability... god, I wanted him to be here til he retired.Not an NBA fan, do you mind explaining what happened to him?This is hilarious what is the contact for this?    I know the player but how does he know Derrick Rose?He just really needed to get that off his chest.We all men tonightSpeak for yourse....you know what, not today Yahoo commenterNBA.. I love this game :'( Bro, his interview actually got me emotional, and that doesn't happen often. I'm so happy for himWE ARE ALL CRYING.  Derrick deserves it. It seemed like he was a few years from being out of the league but he just kept grinding and has now given his value an incredible boost. Dude just wants to ball and tonight probably added some serious time onto his NBA life. After such an extended stretch of stress from MIN as well it's great to see this team come together and be hyped for their brother. Yeah I'm crying.All I could think was awww. I‚Äôm so happy for him yep. i'm cryingTonight all real men cry! Why arent you crying with us?r/nbaww Sports haven't gotten me like this since Kobe's last game. Absolutely beautiful.I 100% started balling when rose was crying and the crowd was chanting Yes I amthis was so coolLink me daddy  Edit: [Found it I think](https://streamable.com/5tcou)"I worked my ass off" with his voice cracking. Yup, tears. When the men cry[I don't need no woman to feel a certain way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMD2TwRvuoU)This is Derrick Rose. He was the #1 overall pick for his hometown Chicago Bulls. He won the MVP in 2011, becoming the youngest player to do so ever in only his 3rd season at the age of 22 years, 6 months. He embodied the city of Chicago, growing up in the rough streets of the city, by showing his grit and determination.

Rose required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012‚Äì13 season.[3] Rose returned to play in 2013‚Äì14. However, on November 22, 2013, during a regular season game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Rose injured his right meniscus which caused him to miss the remainder of the season.[4] Rose returned once again the following season, but knee injuries continued to riddle him, causing him to miss 30 games. In June 2016, he was traded to the New York Knicks. After one season with the Knicks, Rose joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in July 2017, but was traded and subsequently released by the Utah Jazz the following February."  Basically, a player who grew up playing for his hometown Chicago Bulls with the trajectory to become an all-time great, had his career derailed by injury after injury after injury, all serious injuries that would have made most players retire. But he kept going, and landed up here in the Timberwolves. And he just scored 50 pts. 50.after literally breaking or tearing a muscle in both his legs.  Derrick rose  has a career night   dropping 50 points .  dude almost quit bball last seasoninjuries robbed us of true greatness. thats what happened. For real. What an awesome dude. He played like crazy tonight too. Those fakes were so dirty. Can you explain the significance of this to me? I don't watch NBA.Best Halloween gift ever Thank you. I commented on that too. That kind of work ethic is what makes someone special. No matter the field. So inspiring to me. And makes me want to root for him. Let's go drose. Keep suceeding baby. Show them how winnings done.Best moment of the season so farYou cant have me drop 50 without me!In this clip: we need each other.This game will be remembered.  This is NBA history.  This will be in YouTube compilations until we dieThey said he would rise, and Derrick RoseIn the club on HalloweenI'm with you. I loved that this happened and his raw emotional response validates my own feelings about ittaking a shit - cryingLiterally at a bar alone for Halloween wiping my eyes He loves the game so much to give upDRose game winner against the Cavs in the 2015 playoffs is a close 2nd in my heartAre we all taking off our Jimmy Hats to root for Big D?It‚Äôs ironic that you‚Äôre the first one who brought up lebron and the Lakers in this thread. You‚Äôve become what you hate the most"Could the Lakers trade for Rose?"You should probably get that checked out, bro.anything is possiblekeep your head up broI feel you so hard bro. Dude is the sole reason for my love of the game, this gives me so much hope.  Seriously gonna cry my ass off lmfao, no shame.Watching this clip, all that came to my mind was "fuck Jimmy Butler"I wanna see D Rose in a Bulls number 1 jersey again. Has always been one of my favourite players, and seeing him in anything other than Bulls red is still weird. Yeah bro. And Teague was a team player today. On the bench cheering all game and first to greet Rose at the end. THIS TEAM IS A TEAM without Butler.Stuck with this man through everything. I went out and bought a Derrick Rose Cavs shirt shortly after he signed with them. I can't explain it but there isn't any other player I love more than DRose.This is Derrick Rose.

And he just scored 50 pts. 50.Too big too fast too strong.... too good!<3 Of course - I want everyone to be inspired :) ain‚Äôt no way d rose playing at this level this year would be with the third stringers but i see what you meanJimmy's my father but Rose is my daddy He really did, MVP to trashed on and almost out of the league. We're all crying tonight man. Happy cake day!Sixers fan checking in. I fucking love drose and this makes me so happyYour username... one of the best NBA related commercials ever made.Don't think I've ever wanted a team to beat LeBron in the playoffs more than the prime Rose Bulls. The Mavs team was #2. 2 time MVP after this yearI thought those games would be boring blowouts and Rose made them something special. First round of the playoffs last year was good all around except maybe the Wizards series.This. I kept wondering why nobody even mentioned his name when talking about the Wolves ahead of his season. You could see something was coming if you paid attention to how good he looked in the playoffs...As much as I love D Rose and think that'd be awesome, I think he's in the perfect situation as it is right now. He's an unbelievably talented player who can have explosive games like this, but with Jimmy, KAT, and Teague there, he doesn't have to strain himself as much, making injuries less of a worry without having him warming the bench. But I'm no coach or sports analyst so wtf do I know.I‚Äôve been saying this forever! I even got downvoted for saying Derrick Rose is still a good player. The guy hasn‚Äôt been a number 1 option in how long? Of course his numbers haven‚Äôt looked as good as they were but he‚Äôs still fucking good!If the franchise was smart they'd never take those off again It feels like they all played with as much heart as KG did tonightRose showed the kind of heart that KG would have been proud of.Honestly those jerseys are so gorgeous Really made this game even more special. The Jazz should've thrown on the purple mountain jerseys/r/nbawwThe real trade was the friendship they made along the way Jimmy sticks his head out from peeking around the corner. Smiles at his teammates winning with friendship. He throws his head back, looks up as a tear rolls down.   KG comes up and pats him on the back, ‚Äúyou had to do it, you needed to push them. they needed to learn‚Äù   ‚ÄúI know Kev, it was just so hard‚Äù I'm feeling some real Yu-Gi-Oh heart of the cards vibesIt's a team game. Teamwork matters. I really think the weather and everything would be great for Rose in Miami. Especially with DJ Khaled's motivation, he might average 30I honestly would just keep him out. Look how fucking fired up that team was. Trade him by Monday. Fuck Jimmy ButlerYeah I definitely agree, try and get some real assets to gel with this core or you know, 4 first round picksME too bro! I fucking love seeing him balling his heart out. This is amazing.Man I fucking love D.Rose this man has given me so many ups and downs and now he‚Äôs just balling his heart out doing his best and fucking crying, my heart can only take so much my godTeague is actually just a really good team guy. He's always cheering dudes on from the bench.As Gobert said get that shit(Butler) outta here. > made fun of him for shooting hoops alone in a gym  LOL A basketball player working on basketball?! What a fuckass, right guys? Trying to improve at his job or something? Weak!   For reals someone mocked him? That's probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard.Remember the post that showed Derrick Rose in a suit for every NBA team?Imagine if we went into overtime? 60 points possiblyCan't wait for Dirk's last game against Utah. He's gonna drop 41 all off of turnaround fadeawaysyou and me bothEven Michael Jordan's "final" game as a Bulls was vs Jazz, got 45 pts and a championship trophy to go along with it.üéµ what do these things have in common üéµFirst MJ, then Kobe and now Rose  LBJ going to put 70 on the jazz in his last game and Curry going to drop 20 3sHe was the mvp in the 2011 season and then injuries derailed his career and he never played the same.  He was a really humble  person that was humbled even more.  This was a breakout game for him and you can tell it really meant a lot to him.He was the most valuable player in the league at one point. He had a very bright future. But he kept getting injured after his mvp year. Both knees have been through hell and back. He hasn't been the same player since and his hometown team traded him away. So scoring 50 points today was a huge deal to him because it felt like he's back to his old self. When he used to carry his team day in and day out. This was so beautiful.He was one of the best players in the league and won the MVP in 2011. Then he blew out an ACL and was never the same, would be on the road to recovery then suffer another debilitating knee injury that would sideline him for the season, but he was incredible. [Here](https://youtu.be/-E4WOsriE5M) are the highlights of his MVP season. Seeing him have his career high this many years later after working so hard on his recovery when so many others would retire in comfort, it's good to see.What made Derrick Rose such a dominant force in 2011 and previously was his athletic, aggressive style of play.  He was possibly the most dynamic point guard since Magic Johnson (I know maybe Wall or Westbrook too).  His creativity and balance when driving to the cup was reminiscent of Iverson, with as quick of a cross as well.  When Derrick attacked the rim there was never a since of fear.  No matter how fast he was running, spinning, leaping, he always seemed to be relaxed; sleepy even.   A full ACL tear rips those advantages away instantly. He was lost for the season.  Later,maybe he has a good game or two. He jumps for a rebound. Lands. Stands there, reaching for his knee.  Injured again.  etc etc.   This is an amazing comeback.  A long time coming too. Something missing from these other great answers is that Rose was the youngest MVP ever when he won it in 2011. He was a joy to watch and had an amazing career ahead of him that got stolen by injury after heartbreaking injury. I want D rose to get a ring man. Remember when people jumped on him for "not caring" about basketball when he made an inarticulate comment about wanting to be at his kid's graduation? How could anyone say this man doesn't love ballingFuck man. This is the one. This is the comment that got me.In the post game interview he was asked what tonight meant to him. he said "everything man, I worked my ass off bro" all with tears in his eyes and the crowd going crazy in the background. I was tearing up. That game tonight was special for more than just Derrick. All the shit he‚Äôs been through. My cousin wants told me ‚Äúgold has to go through the fire to be pure‚Äù obviously that‚Äôs bullshit, but DRose has certainly gone through the fire. Even if he never has another good game again this was it, this what solidified him. So many surgeries, so many questions and to go out and drop 50 on this team? The defensive minded Utah Jazz. Idgaf, Derrick Rose you‚Äôre a fucking legend. You‚Äôre the gold. you can tell he's been practicing so much, trying to get a better jumper to compensate his loss of explotion.Seriously. Rehab sucks. Multiple rehabs for a player in the pros who already had an MVP season....i cant even come close to comprehending.Gonna shit yourself?I think we all are. It's so rare (and awesome) to see elite athletes show vulnerability in such a way. Really happy for DRose, he was on of my favorites back in his Bulls daysI'm not crying, you're crying.Link? Yo can someone who knows Chinese browse their forums and check out what they're saying about tonight??I'm with you fellow basketball homeyNormal famTHESE BITCHES LOVE ROSE- AAA!*young chop on the beat*On sight! This really is the greatest sub, got dayumGoddamn this is golden >I wanted him to be here til he retired.  Hell he almost was :/   &nbsp;   I like this storyline better now.No reason you guys can't max him next yearHe was drafted by his hometown team, the Bulls, after a really rough childhood. Immediately impresses everyone with his skill, and wins Rookie of the Year. The next season, he‚Äôs an all star. The season after that, he becomes the youngest MVP in league history. He‚Äôs one of the most explosive players in the league; he can cut to the hoop like no one else. He‚Äôs the best Bull since Jordan, and there‚Äôs hope that he might lead us to a championship.   The next season, he tears an ACL in the playoffs. He has to take an entire season off to recover. A month or so after he comes back, he tears his meniscus and is out for the season. The next season, he has a minor knee injury. Through all this, his explosiveness is almost gone. He‚Äôs still good, but nowhere near what he was.   Eventually, he got traded to the Knicks, where he tore his other meniscus. Then he played for half a season with the Cavs, and got picked up by the Wolves. Since joining Minnesota, he‚Äôs shown a lot of maturity and has had flashes of brilliance. His career was thought to be over several years ago, but he‚Äôs completely beaten the odds.He tore his left ACL in one of his early seasons (2012), after winning MVP in 2011. He honestly has just never been quite the same player. He also tore one of his menisci in the same knee, which slowed him down even more.   I've had ACL surgery and it is absolutely brutal. Takes forever to be able to play any sport again and be at your previous level, let alone at an NBA level. It is mentally and emotionally extremely challenging, and you often feel like you'll never be the same player, or even person. Rose is a huge inspiration to everyone because of how he has battled and stuck around in spite of his own body robbing him of what was undoubtedly going to be a HOF career. D Rose was a 21 year old league MVP for Chicago. Youngest ever. Brought an otherwise paltry bulls team to the 1st seed competing against LeBron in the East. Was primed to be the best player in the league, even. A brutal injury robbed him of his limitless potential. He spent the next few years on injured reserve and playing lackluster ball for the Knicks and a few months of bench play on the Twolves.  Today, in a start, Rose dropped 50 points, his career high.Griezmann is a huge NBA fan and you can regularly see him supporting DRose, he's his favorite playerDrose and grizemann even swapped jerseys when he visited New York It's even funnier when you consider this is the interview right after they won the world cup and that's the first thing that comes to his mind, real dedicated fan.Been waiting for the chance.  When somebody might care what he had to say.  So he won a World Cup...i hope someone makes a streamable of itlink?I haven't teared up over sports in a long time . Man.. respect to DRose, this is an inspirational momentI need that linkIt's a terrible day for rain..This is definitely the least upset I've been after a loss.  That was incredible, Rose couldn't miss and then he gets the last block?  Couldn't have scripted something better.Legit got me really emotional and that doesn't happen often. Go droseHighlight of the season already. Fucking love D Rose. Other than Jordan, he's still my only non-Raptor jersey.  Fuck...this is amazing. So happy for him. We men? We men.FUCKWhy'd you do this to meAnd now I'm crying AGAINFUCKRespect to whoever that is from Fox doing the interview. Super good pacing with the first question to give him time to collect himselfYou can assume. Wow that's insane. Thanks for the quick reply!Is this his first game back? Not that it isn't incredible otherwise, just looking for contextMan, reading that felt like a HOF induction. Hey man, sure.   Derrick Rose was once the MVP of the league and was deemed one of THE best players in the league at the time. His career went south once he tore his ACL. The ACL injury ruined his career the first time, and then it happened again. The ACL injury happening once alone is essentially career ending. It changes how a player moves, shoots and all of that. It completely changes how their movement functions essentially. So it happening twice and him getting cut from Traded from the Bulls to the Knicks to the Jazz, getting cut by the Jazz, signing with the T-Wolves and still being in the league is crazy enough.  A lot of NBA fans LOVE D-Rose. We all feel bad for him with the amount of depression he went through cause of the ACL injuries, altering his career and plaguing his injury with other injuries. Him having this 50 point night out of nowhere is absolutely insane for someone who has been on and off career wise/point wise. This might be our last glimpse at that old vintage MVP form that he once had years ago.Grew up in one of the toughest/most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago. Stayed out of trouble, worked real hard and used basketball as his ticket out of a life of poverty.  Makes it all the way to the NBA as the #1 overall selection, drafted by his hometown team the Chicago Bulls.   Single-handedly transforms the Bulls from a mediocre at best team into the top team in the Eastern conference. He gave the entire city of Chicago hope and excitement. It is not at all an exaggeration to say that he was a hero here in Chicago.  In his first couple seasons, he looked like he was an all-time great talent. He was the youngest player ever to win the league Most Valuable Player award.   On top of all this, he was such a unique player with an explosive style that was absolutely incredible to watch.   It seemed like he was destined to become a legend in both Chicago and the NBA, first ballot Hall of Fame, etc.   Then, he suffered his first devastating knee injury in the playoffs. Missed a ton of time, worked so hard to come back. Comes back, wasn't the same but slowly starts showing flashes of greatness once again, but it was inconsistent.   Right when everyone started daring to hope that D. Rose was "back" and recovered from blowing out his knee, it happens again. He tore his miniscus in his other (uninjured knee). After such a long long road of recovery, he came all the way back to the brink of realizing his destiny and fulfilling the dreams of his fans. He worked so hard for it, he deserved it. Then, it happened again.  After all the work and recovery and injuries, it seemed like he would not only never be the same, but that he would fizzle out of the league altogether.   Then he gets picked up by the T-Wolves, with the same coach as he had back with the bulls. And here we are.   All treat no trickThe Rose that grew from concrete Made me cry fr brotaking a shit - staring at my phone blankly while crying on the inside crying rn - cryingIn the club taking a shit and crying Ok, I lost my shit way more that night. My god you‚Äôre right.............DAMN YOU STEPHEN A!!!!deadass, could theyHis 30 for 30 just keeps getting fucking better.No way he was on the starters team either thoughThere was a long period of time where it was looking like he would never return to form, but now it's looking like he's already back lolGoddamn it's been 6 years since I came to this cesspool.  I love you bunch of degenerates great pac poem tooCouldn‚Äôt agree more! Built up the legend of D Rose so much. i thought rose was gonna ruin the big 3. bittersweet maaan there are so many people i wanna root for to get the MVP this year. Kawhi (obvious reasons), DeRozan (thats my dude), D Rose (thats my dude)This is a stupid question please ignore my ignorance. But if he really makes a comeback and has another MVP caliber season, could he win MIP? He would obviously be improving a tremendous amount compared to the last ~5 seasonsHow to fist sisters> If the franchise was smart  I have some bad news for you.THERE'S MAGIC IN THEM JERSEYSSpree looked so badass with these onDeadass that's what this team has been missing. That kinda heart. D Rose had it tonight. That's the thing about heart though, one person can affect a whole team that way. Sorry if that don't make sense I'm kinda drunk tbhYeah, and who wasn't playing tonight?At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Rose  yelled over to the team  and screamed ‚Äúyou (bleeping) need friendship. You can‚Äôt win without it.‚Äù Rose left teammates and coaches largely warm in the heart. He dominated their feelings in every way. Derricks back. /r/nbanimeFriendship is magic And just like that, Butler was gone. After the Wolves back to back titles they began to wonder if Jimmy Butler had ever even played for the Wolves, but Thibs looked on from his chair in front of a cozy fire and he knew. He remembered.Can someone make an anime style comic of this. Lmao stop Now they need to just draw a smiley face on their hands and shadow games can‚Äôt even get in their wayD Rose activated MVP rebornAnd jimmy was not needed that day.You can't play him again after that. You have to go with this. Agreed. This is real leadership, not bitching and moaning. Butler isn't wrong, but there's a correct way to say something without demoralizing your team and looking like an asshole yourself. Upvoted because ‚Äúfuckass‚Äù is my favorite diss It was basically along the lines of ‚ÄúWow former MVP and now he‚Äôs such a scrub he can‚Äôt get nobody to shoot with him‚Äù obviously not worded like that, but the intent was very obviousWe had 3 chances to tie the game and missed them all.  We deserved the loss and it would've been disappointing for the Wolves to lose after Rose's game.    I wonder who is going to torch the jazz next. Can't wait for 2030 when Lebron drops  82 pt game on them. Why are the Jazz just the sacrificial lamb for feel good vintage performances?Not to mention that his 50 points tonight is the highest he‚Äôs ever had in one game.[deleted]Idc if he gets it when he‚Äôs 35 as an end of bench player who‚Äôs there just for a vet presence I want him to get one. There‚Äôs very few who deserve vindication like him man. The entire post injury saga with a bulls was basically a lesson on the exact things to not say and do for both the player and the organization. Sucked. I knew he cared when he was popping up at different playoff games that year just so he could experience that environment again. I think it was his month long absence to get marriedWhat did he sayThis comment boomed you Not just the defensive minded Utah Jazz, but the defensive minded Utah Jazz that waived him. Why am I crying in the club rnIt‚Äôs his love for the game that shines through... And hits us - no matter where we are in the world.  Wow, this is awesome. He‚Äôs awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ua1o5k6-4https://youtu.be/GLZ4XBTtVTgHalf of the "hot" posts on hupu are about Rose. They still love him over there. [Google Translate of their NBA page](https://imgur.com/a/Sa8Gsjc). I highlighted the ones about Rose (some of them say "Ross" due to transliteration).Fucking with D Rose yea, you gonna get dunked on yea Not to mention that time he was waived by the jazz and was shooting alone in an empty gym. Your injuries set you back. But your hard work and determination will get you back. Respect to him.This is why Greizmann is my favorite soccer player.love itAs one normally does when they want to talk[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge\_yq6\_WtpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge_yq6_WtpE)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge\_yq6\_WtpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge_yq6_WtpE)What do you mean? It's not raini‚Äî  ...Oh. So it is.Link for the uninformed: https://youtu.be/s7HcPvTew_4  (One is the GOAT anime‚Äôs. Brotherhood over original don‚Äôt @ me)I'm so glad they inbounded it to him for those two free throws other than the much more wide open KAT. Thank you for asking! I was in the same boat of just not knowing what was going on. Love a solid come back story and I‚Äôm rooting for the guy. Worth noting also he was basically bounced around between 4 teams in the last year. He was eventually cut by the Utah Jazz (Who he just beat), and could not get a contract from any NBA team. His former coach (When he was MVP) is now the coach for the Timberwolves and decided to give him a chance on a minimum contract of 1 million. Everyone had written him off as done only a few months ago. A few injuries forced him to start tonight and he scored the 50 points.For context on how great he was during his MVP season, here's his [2010-2011 highlight reel](https://youtu.be/GOtxJrzp6ls).Watch this to get some perspective on how exciting of a player he was: https://youtu.be/t71IqHJOqgEAnother thing people aren‚Äôt mentioning is that he was mercilessly mocked by trolls online (here too) and was the butt of jokes for years because of his injuries. > 50 pts  career highNope, but he's been playing aight so far. This game, however, he just exploded for 50.Oh wow a 50-pt night is pretty crazy. This story gives me a bit of hope for my favorite team. I am a hockey fan--a St. Louis Blues fan specifically. We have a player, Robby Fabbri, who was a rising-star player who [tore his ACL](https://www.nhl.com/blues/video/fabbri-exits-game-early/t-277437432/c-49083703) back in February 2017. He got surgery and was expected to be back that fall (October 2017). Well, he had torn it again around September 2017 and this time his recovery was taken a lot slower, instead of almost "rushing it" as it had been seen previously.. He was actually *just* recalled to the Blues today, so hopefully we will see him back in action soon. The Blues could use a little help as they have been struggling at the start of this season. Just thought I'd share a little tidbit of this realm of sports as a "thank you" for you taking the time to explain it to me.   An ACL injury is tough... but twice is definitely something else. I hope Rose plays well and has a healthy remainder of his career.D Rose 50 points, no bamboozleGoat nba commercialdone fapping - cryingHe never will return to form, he can't play the same way he played pre-2010 where he would fly in and dunk a rebound over forwards. But he's adapting and doing what he can do. Not about being the same player he was it's about doing what he can to have longevity.Don't really watch the NBA. Any TLDR on this dude?Man, remember when he was cut last season and there was a video of him chucking up jump shots by himself in a high school gym? This is crazyLet‚Äôs slow it down a bit, it‚Äôs one game but I hope you‚Äôre right I just hope that he doesn't push himself too hard and reaggravates the kneeI stopped watching sports (BBall included) a few years ago.  Watched the highlights tonight...cried.  Fuckin' Ahttps://youtu.be/HabwTo6YgQIIt‚Äôs shocking how quickly this sub has forgiven Kawhi, Raptors fans are rightfully pulling for him but I thought for 29 other teams he‚Äôd be among the 5-10 most disliked players after the debacle last season but that hasn‚Äôt happened at all. He suffered basically no reputation hit but after forcing his way out a beloved franchise in the ugliest way possible, all it took was a meme laugh and a few elite games and it‚Äôs all water under the bridge apparently.I don't know about Kawhi. I can't hate him for looking out for number one but he just handled everything so poorly and handled himself even worse. I wish him the best but he's gonna need to make up ground after that showcase. Well ya got me there. I think you're slightly biased though. The news is dont you EVER talk about Stevie Francis like that again!At least they didn't draft OkaforThere better not beI could have sworn I saw Terrell Brandon out there  Turns out it was James Nullnnany ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è[deleted]Happy Halloween bro!  Fellow drunk dude on HalloweenWhen Kawhi isn't playing alongside his roster, they seem to lose the anticipation that he brings. Fully comprehended what you said: it makes sense I'm kinda high tbhAbsolutely. You can tell how much the young guys respect him, couldn't be more happy to have him on the wolves. Feels good man, I love you D roseLove the Timberbulls.Pick your favorite team and a time they‚Äôve had a phenomenal season (if applicable). Now tell me they weren‚Äôt an exciting, lovable, teamwork-centric unit.  That‚Äôs how you win 99.9% of the time IMO. I think he‚Äôs absolutely right.power of nakama OPNeeds to be a thingNUTThibs said nothing. The liquor had all died out of him and left him alone. His assistant coaches weren't there. He wasn‚Äôt sitting at the bar or running a practice tomorrow or anything. He wasn‚Äôt drunk. It was all gone. All he knew was that he had once had Jimmy Butler and that he had lost him. He was gone and he had sent him away. That was all that mattered. He might never coach Jimmy again. Probably he never would. It was all gone, finished.Jimmy: If you do something right, people won't be sure you did anything at all.Cue a shot of Jimmy's back, tucked away in a raincoat, as he walks away from the arena and into the night. TOPDECK TIME BOYSFrom Chicago's graveyard. Rose is 10x the leader Butler ever could be. Yeah, I agree. Jimmy's a beast and he has legitimate qualms and grievances with KAT and Wiggins, but it didn't have to go down like this.Being right is overrated imo. Rodney Hood could spend the entire season stomping around and screaming "Cavs suck man!! We don't got a coach!" These are technically true statements and yet it would do no good and be a major net negative.   Being "right" and "honest" is good, sometimes. Borderline bullying your teammates and overall making yourself a massive distraction and emotional sinkhole is putrid. The first group of traits in no way make up for the second. he is wrong tho. he is under contract, he has no legit right to demand a trade. you don't like it? offer a cheap buyout if you want out that much. Yeah it was a cheap clip taken of him shooting around in a random gym with a kid. The kid was probably through the roof, but the entire purpose was to poke fun at Rose.[deleted]Nah, LeBron will get his first LeBron. He'll finally drop 27/7/7 against the Jazzlol 2030? He'll still be in his prime. To add context to his MVP year, he was the youngest league MVP in history just 7 years ago. This should be the age where he should be hitting his prime. Sadly, the world never got to witness what prime Derrick rose looks like So he didn't play last year? Oh damn i forgot about that To recover from bone spurs*, happened to get married in the interimThis meme will not die. This meme will not die. This meme will not die. This meme will not die. I still wear his bulls adidas shoes with pride. I wont forget the player who made me love basketball "No matter what team you're on we will always support you." Imagine hearing that. I'd cry too lolLmao that transition from the heartfelt message to smashing shit with a hammer was something I wasn‚Äôt prepared for SAvedI'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYINGRiza best girlr/unexpectedfmaThis will forever be the best NBA highlight video. I love how this Diddy song has now been associated with D Rose for most /r/nba fans just because of this vid.Damn I loved this video so much. The ending allusion with MJ really resonated with me. D-Rose's ceiling was so high. What a great game to watch last night.Yep. He's got a good mid range jumperLuckily the game has changed anyway and it's more about shot selection and FT shooting, so there is less need for his old playstyle. Prime Rose was ferocious. Better than Westbrook.This. So much. The dude waddles went he walks. You can hear his knees grinding from the upper deck. It‚Äôs really a tragedy. If he were healthy, he‚Äôd be a top 10 player. Dude is mad skilled. So skilled he can put up 50 with bad knees. Youngest MVP in NBA history in 2011, got injured in the playoffs and was never really relevant again due to that and recurring injuries.  For awhile there were rumors he was just going to outright retire since he could never be healthy. Today he scored 50 points, his career high, and his team won the game.Just for further color, grew up in the roughest part of Chicago. His family protected him from  gangs and the other landmines that could have brought him down. Was drafted by his hometown Bulls with the #1 overall pick. After a long fallow period for the Bulls preceding Derrick, he (and with the help of a coaching change) brought the Bulls from a middling team to the best record in the conference, while winning the MVP (youngest to ever win the award), and carrying the hopes and dreams of his city on his back.  He was also seen as a super humble kid, drawn in contrast to LeBron and the Heatles. One of my low key fav, DRose moments was the starting lineup announcements for the All Star game, everyone was preening, high on their own supply and home boy looked like he wanted to have nothing to do with that scene .  I honestly will never forgive Thibs for leaving him in against the 6ers in the playoffs in an already decided contest. I kniw that's his MO, but fuck,  he was in and out of the lineup with nagging injuries that whole year.He was the youngest MVP in NBA history and he used to consistently make plays like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t71IqHJOqgE   Then he tore his ACL playing garbage time with a lead in a playoff game and he wasn't ever the same.He‚Äôs playing for Thibs..........Memes and elite performances are all this sub cares about.I don‚Äôt even know where you sittin at ehhaHYUHYUHYUhuhuh  Edit: missed a HYUMy elementary music teachers name was Mr. Fister. We made a story about him.   Mr. Fister had a sister and he kissed her playing twister. Yeah well stop telling females what they're able to do in the gym!For a brief period of time, Magic was on everything.  The floorboards, the locker room, the comforter, her dress, the door knob.Happy Halloween my dude!When AD takes the day off, his teammates look like the bugs you see underneath a freshly unearthed concrete block. I do not fully comprehend what you said: it makes no sense. I'm kinda trippin' tbh "EVERBODY LOVE EVERYBODY"  - the GOAT player/coach/owner Jackie MoonThe soulless, fun-hating New England Patriots disagree.2002 Lakers, unfortunately, 2004 even more so.It's more that winning breeds happy players and unselfishness.I think this is true in any sport.  In basketball. Look at warriors. They symbolize loveavle, teamwork, centric unit.  This is true, but it kind of goes both ways: it's a lot easier for everyone to get along when the team is winning and everyone is playing wellderrick rose one piece spin off?*sigh*  I got GoosebumpsThe role of a leader is how to handle said qualms and grievances; not just in finding solutions but more importantly how that leader goes about finding them. Butler is Zapp Brannigan. I'm so happy for Rose and your team.  AnythingIsPossible.gifI'm out of the loop, what happened?Yeah, still a miss though.Luke Walton benches Lebron in Q2. 27/7/7 is better than 54/14/14 for his last gameAnd lose, as LeBron is destined to always lose to Utah and the lakers are cursed in Salt Lake CityHe did but not a whole lotHe got picked up by Minnesota after the Jazz waived him last year. Hands fuckin downHe always had the midrange. It‚Äôs encouraging that he‚Äôs making his threes now.Imagine tellin that to a Memphis a few years ago....He haven‚Äôt even reached his peak then. 2011 rose wasn‚Äôt even in his prime yet. Imagine him reaching his full potential.I think he literally was too powerful for his own ligaments. Either that or he just  monumental bad luck. Its sad but he will serve as a warning to future athletes about preventative care.Recurring injury is an understatement. He blew out his knee multiple times, which would put anyone‚Äôs career in jeopardy Thanks Brotendo [deleted]This puts into perspective how big of a deal today was. Honestly one of my favorite sports stories in a year or more. I think we‚Äôre all Derrick Rose fans right now.His team won by 3 points and DRose got the block that ended the game. He  wasn't just padding stats, he carried that team. DRose is back.Surprisingly tame given the circumstances.maybe they're a female who is willing to be told what they're able to do in the gym. it's 2016 smhyou forgot promoter Eagles had fun when they played them tho and how‚Äôd that go?They still would‚Äôve lost the big dance to Mario chalmers?Brandon Roy will like to have a word with you. Adding more context: the knee is the single most important body part to a basketball player (obviously apart from missing arms and legs) and the types of injuries he had (1x torn acl, 2x torn meniscus) are almost insurmountable. Not sure what sports you follow but his story can be related to Ronaldo Lima‚Äôs story in soccer, and maybe even Sean Taylor for football, although to a lesser extent since obviously he‚Äôs still been able to play, although only as a fraction of his former self until now. Many great players have had their career stunted/shortened by injuries like these, and for a player like D Rose, who was incredibly flashing and jumping and cutting everywhere, he really had to change his entire game in order to be able to keep playing, so seeing him score 50 in this stage of his career is surreal.He beat lebron for mvp that year. Prime d rose is legendaryI appreciate your manners Brotato Chip.Like go actually watch prime d rose highlights, that shit was beautiful to watch.Wasn't his first injury against the 6ers in the first round of the playoffs?Our vocabulary was still developing for sure. The way drose played tonight it feels like 2011Stop don't make me cryUhh I don‚Äôt think you mean Sean TaylorOr Eduardo. Or Abou Diaby. Or Jack Wilshere. Or Tomas Rosicky.  Fucking Arsenal.>Prime d rose  Sounds like it comes out of the oven and makes me wanna slather honey glaze all over it Crazy shit is we were robbed of his actual prime. Who knows what 27 year old injury free DRose looks like.well he *did* have a career-ending leg injury...yum  unfortunately the way he‚Äôs playing it‚Äôll take at least 3-4 guys to hold him down and get him into the ovenPrime d rose slathered in honey glaze basically sums up how saucey and sweet  2011 D Rose was. He did what steph did with the three ball but he did it going to the rim and hitting the craziness and otherwise making grown men look like that tall goofy kid from high school gym class.

Fuck my life.Wade served justice Wow flash... great shot! Legend üôåüèΩD-WADE!!!!   Watch that in slo-mo, it‚Äôs ridiculous...  How did he compose himself after getting blocked, he literally caught the ball, knew there was less than a second, dragged one foot quickly behind the 3-point line, kept the other foot off the floor so it‚Äôs not inside the 3, and heaved it quickly..  He‚Äôs got that deadeye ability from Red Dead Redemption!! Sees the game in slow motion wow haha don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen that before on a game winnerOff topic. What are the odds that Miami just go permanent with the vice jerseys? Seems like every game they're wearing the vice colors which I think are sexy as fuck and would definitely rock. Dwayne Wade hitting a crazy 3 in the last seconds in his last season against the most over powered team in basketball might just be my favorite moment ever.Has anyone else just completely blocked out the bulls/cavs years ? I know I have, I cant even fathom what he looked like in those jerseysMarry me D Wade I fucking love you I LOVE YOUCraziest shot this year[deleted]Can't even be salty. I love it. I told my bro that he was gonna take the last shot and miss to lose when we were down 24 in the second quarter. No jersey swap today. That's a keeper. Only legends be pulling this shit off. OG LEGEND D-Wade.Wade county bonus: +50 Contested 3 pointerMy boy D-Wade still a killer!!**"THANK YOU!!!!!!"**  \-- A Nuggets fanSorry man... if I‚Äôm looking at building a team, I‚Äôd take Dwade over A.I. at the SG position 100 percent of the time. He can do it all, doesn‚Äôt need to score to be effective, excellent leader, great defense, and he‚Äôs clutch.Fuuuuck. Good for Wade. Why‚Äôd they let the heat get that free timeout though?Unbelievable. Dion Waiters passed up the attempt Can‚Äôt even be upset, what an ending. I"m honestly not even madI ain't even mad. That was hilarious.I'm glad we lost this way, what a crazy sequenceI'm okay with this, that was amazing. Unbelievable career for Wade, so happy for this guy.This kills the Warriorsim not even mad. that was pretty coolVice City!!!#WHAT IN THE WORLDLocal hour about to be lit Holy shit D-wade has cornrows One last fucking death dancehe yeeted that 3 Believe it or not as a Warriors fan I was happy for Wade.  I was disturbed with the lack of effort by the Dubs that I felt like they did not deserve to win.  Its what you deserve when you take *any* NBA team lightly.  They thought they could just turn it on late and outmatch Miami but D Wade is a legend.Did anybody else just smile for a solid 30 seconds after seeing this clip?Dubs fan here, not even mad.[deleted]Truly is WADE COUNTYThey say Father Prime had passed him by[Wow](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/53036307_2229446523838059_8189774391702192128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=748db009525cf099fc2cdabb45ebf5c0&oe=5D163143)WHAT JUST HAPPENEDHahahahahahahahahaTHOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA HOT POTATO TO AN L ONLY TO GET THE CRAZIEST CIRCUS SHOT WINwhat a crazy shot. thanks for memories Wade.Such a nice way to win.

Retirement is purely a choice because he definitely has a place in the league still. We'll take him for the veteran minimum.The whole game was competitive. Watch the replay manana.I love this man an unhealthy amount Natural baller.  Its in his blood.  the presence of mind to lift that front foot to get behind the line...FATHER PRIMEI just love that he did his celebration, where he jumps on the table  I wish OP showed it hereRENAME BISCAYNE ALREADYMIAMI WADEMiami-Wade County, let's make it happen boys!just being a killer as usual even on his retirement tourDevin Harris did it kindahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9AHF1lwemMNot exactly related, but this keeps me up at night.  You guys remember when Tyreke evans had that full court buzzer beater?   You know the one where his bench was clearing in celebration before it went in? [the balls this takes to celebrate while the ball is in flight requires an energy level I cant comprehend](https://youtu.be/n0xJM1Z7kos?t=50)This is probably going to be my most memorable regular season play of his when I think back about his legacy decades from now2004 Spurs-Lakers game 5. Duncan hits  a ridiculous shot to give the Spurs a lead with 0.4 seconds left. [Derek Fisher hit a game winning shot](https://youtu.be/RodiAAns6Jk) even though there's no way he could have launched the shot in time. Still controversial to this day. Miami will build him 3 statues.That running 3 pointer? Yeah that was fucking dopeI swear half of Wade's buzzers are some crazy ass bank shotsCornrow Dwade!!!This is definitely one of the best ones I've ever seen. That pump fake was money and then Durant recovers and manages to get a hand on it, Wade still keeps some control and tries to fire, and then Bell gets a piece of it (or at least alterered the shot enough for it come loose), and Wade still manages to pick it up spin and fire off one leg in under half a second. Absolutely incredible shot. https://youtu.be/C7J8zlWatJoI kept on thinking I would totally be fine with Miami getting the dub with a DWade buzzer beater. And, I am. That was fucking unbelieavable.He just scores the most unusual buzzer beaters, doesn't he. LOL.i gotta agreeTotal circus stuff. I loved it!I think this is #1 D Wade is a top 50 killer of all time and he‚Äôs not 2-50The focus and composure Wade has is amazingWade loves the fumbled buzzer beater.That was fucking awesome. We're gonna be seeing this in top 10s for years lmao that was unrealThis clip ended way too soon.  Need to see him hop up on that table, pound his chest, and confirm his permanent claim as king of Miami Game winner of the yearYou just know this play is gonna be on every highlight reel of his ever. Unless he pulls off something crazier in the future this will be his equivalent of Kobe putting up 60 against the Jazz. It's just to good of a story, clean buzzer beater against the best team in the league showing that he can still turn it on from time to time, even in his last season. Aside from the initial shock the Warriors players didn't even seem that mad about it, Curry was embracing him shortly afterwards. The story is just too good. Wade > Tebowi'm crying like an ugly bitch in my dorm's dining hall right nowCan't even get mad at thisAnd the 3 right before this too holy ballsD motherfucking WadeWtf best game winner of the seasonV I N T A G ELive by the 3, die by the 3 Shit. Best of his career given the opponent. this is one of the greatest, ever. It was probably a lot of luck but still, sometimes those are the best ones  Great game winner on his farewell tourima still go with hardens Harden no questionThis was poetry, man. Retiring Wade buzzer beater against the league's best team at home. Can't stop grinningThe way it should be!You have to give credit to the coaching staff there. That is just a well drawn up play. Warriors got outcoached.Steph was smiling as well lolIt's such a weird mix of emotions right now. I'm thankful I got to witness that. up to the top of /r/nba we gohttps://i.gifer.com/Nc0b.gif  Seriously though what a great highlight for his farewell tour.It was great defense too what a moment DWade is a godThe only bad thing I can say about Wade is that his name is spelled stupid. Besides that I mean he won a championship as the main superstar, was part of an iconic championship team as the second best player. I also will say that Wade's peak is one of the most insane peaks. I mean outside of hitting three pointers he could do anything and he was so athletic that it didn't even matter that he couldn't.Dion Waiters did this to us before and I was just cackling lmaoI'm sure it's nbd losing a regular season game when you know for a fact your team will win the chip every year.You are all really good sports about this. Respect. At 10 at night because IT'S FUCKING WADE COUNTY BITCHES.HE CALLED GAME**AND THE SPURS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT.**Make it larger than the Statue of Liberty!I'm confused as well, he is still a good playerA few reasons:   * Kids  * His knees are in awful shape and they‚Äôll only get worse if he continues  * Millions in the bank  * He wants to bang his wife more than he does now  He's still good in terms of his play but maybe he doesn't feel good anymore? Also better to go out on top. if I recall correctly it has a lot to do with the death of his agent Henry ThomasHe didn't even have to say it when he got on there. Everyone knew.   The American Airlines Arena in Miami will always be his house.He actually mentioned Kobe‚Äôs three in the post game interview on the heat broadcast Both shots had no business going in lmaoHe mentioned that in the post game interview, he shouted kobe out lol[Kobe Bryant Amazing Game Winning Shot Vs Dwyane Wade Heat 09/10 NBA ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRS8wmb64XE)  in case anyone else wanted take a lookHe thanked Kobe for showin him the Mamba Mentality.He actually mentions that play in the post game interview.  My first thought exactlyKD missing that free throw saved us man... he killed us the whole 4th quarter.well it's never easy to come back against Goran "literally Steve Nash" DragicRIP my inbox, I was trying to upload the replays and my phone was just buzzing across the table possessed.this play is gonna end up on his career highlight video holy shit. [Yea but I saw this happen live](https://youtu.be/C7J8zlWatJo). So I'm conflicted on which ones better, the one today or the old one lol its an old pasta but it checks outCavs legend Dwyane WadeSHEESH!!! üëÄüëÄüî•üî•üî• This is my favorite copypasta of all time I see it. I'll make sure to forward this message to Mr. Wade.not this guyplease be me please be me... it's not me is itI feel you bro. When I was 7, I already started watching the Pistons, Lakers, and Spurs play. But it wasn‚Äôt until I was 9, when Wade first played in the league, when I finally got up to start playing. Till now, basketball has always been my #1 escape. Crazy how much a person can impact your life. Thankful to have seen him live. this will be the reason we miss the playoffs, just watch. Wade's parting "fuck you" to CharlotteHe was just on vacation for a season and a halfWell, for 2006 Finals nightmares, you can say they have all been alleviated after 2011 Finals!!Would be hilarious if Adam Silver did that whole "honorary All-Star" thing and then both Wade and Dirk decided to play one more year just to troll the league.Bold to assume it'll be the lastFather primeVince Carter: "Alright, if you insist."Wade's knees: I disagree Wit-zky! Wit-zky! Wit-zky! If you press alt+164 on the keypad, you‚Äôll get the √± for ma√±ana.There‚Äôs no unhealthy amount. D Wade has literally no past mistakes to hate him for Best Miami player ever.Unbelievable. How many people could make that shot, unguarded, in HORSE? If someone made that shot on me I'd just give upNot kinda, completely. That was nuts  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afz7lz7KGM   Another wild, fairly similar one was Mo Pete's  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRBF3JpbnOI  And if that isn't similar enough for you, I don't care. That shot was unreal and always worth postingDidn‚Äôt get blocked firstkevin durant was suspiciously present for both of theseDwyan3 Wad3Replace the city of Miami with a giant wade statuePer square inch Make it 20 feet tall so that it is still above water when Miami is submerged by the sea.I like the way he jumped on the scorers table and hyped the crowd Stealing it then hitting a buzzer beater in 2OT. My brother was at that game. I couldnt go cuz i was too young an it was a school night :CWindy City gamewinner style  Heave at the general directionEver since Kobe hit that crazy bankshot buzzer beater over him. He absorbed itWith Wade retiring and Duncan being out of the league for a while where am I meant to get my regular bank shot fill?Just that type of player. You know youve seen those dudes throwin up wild bank shots at your local gym and they always drain them for some reasonI remember back in the day with the Heatles, people used to say, ‚ÄúWade makes more baskets while falling than (Joel) Anthony makes standing up.‚Äù The man just throws it up and somehow it goes in, it‚Äôs a gift. Giving life to the rest of his body!In 2 years Dwayne wade became Dwayne braid and ayyyyyyyyDread it, run from it, Father Prime still arrives[Durant and blowing it on buzzer beaters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=finxUfh8_IM)  Name a better a combination https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DovAA3EJkIsI'm usually pretty salty when the Warriors lose but this is one I don't mind. Wade is fucking insane.Anybody have a longer clip of this? Really want to see him celebrating on top of the scorers table. I love when players do that shit. Jordan was iconic when he did it. one of the most clutch players in NBA history.Couldn‚Äôt help but smile. Wade is a straight up ballerEven our usually salty announcers weren't mad, that was an amazing shot.Can confirm. One of the most incredible shots ive ever fucking seen.Instant classic, maybe a top ten buzzer beater of all time https://streamable.com/bnaoo"THIS IS MY HOUSE."Big facts homey, I wanna see embracing Gotta love how 3 of the Top 5 game winners of the year are against us.*decadeIt‚Äôs one of those times where you just can‚Äôt be mad. They had some battles in major games and series over the years, to lose the game this way to that man is just amazing. The hottest of takesYou may be an ugly bitch, but you‚Äôre OUR ugly bitch :)Curry and Cook were grinning.  KD and Draymond just shrugged.[my reaction](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HtjNEfPJ2jg/UFIaaoDCgFI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/ADjy05qvZ8s/w1200-h630-p-nu/Alonzo-Mourning.gif)Yeah that was pretty awesome.Nah the double OT one against Chicago still tops this imo. But this is a close secondKd about to have another one of those nightmaresNo way man, the Chicago one was just perfect, it was amazing and the celebration was amazing too, you could tell he was going for the same one after hitting the shot tonight. This one was great as well but the other one it's just perfect Everyone saying this is one of the greatest are def being prisoners of the moment. This was nice, but the steal in OT to runner 3 against Chicago was better. So damn hype. Either way, praise D Wade. Dude goes down as top 3 SG all time.It is lucky but dude always does this ...he's just clutch as hell Same, especially since that 'best game winner of the year' immediately came after the 'worst no call of the year' with Durant out of bounds.Farther out, potentially could have been called for a foul, and over 2 very good defenders draped all over him.   And the menacing stare down at a defeated Draymond Green.Couldn't be happier to sink the dubs either way, but his was waaaay less luckyThey were both incredible I couldn‚Äôt argue with anybody if they picked either one.Just the way spo planned itDraymond just kinda looked at the camera and shrugged.If you don‚Äôt like that shot from D Wade in his last season, you don‚Äôt like basketball. Props from Oakland!I‚Äôm thinking about having my dad call his dad to invite him to my birthday party. That foot was behind the line ofcourse. The basketball gods wanted thistop or /r/all 100% guaranteed. #1Bro dion did this like several times against us. So much PTSD I wanted Miami in the playoffs so bad that year, Dion really showed out. I was hyped watching that dagger over KD that first year he was there. Well they can afford to be. **That statue just got 10 feet taller!**Wait make the Rockets pay for it instead, they've got the bricks to build itDon't wanna end up like Melo.He wanna be with his chillunsYeah it must just be a wants to leave the game on his own terms thing. He is still a valuable player off the bench.Some people would rather be remembered like that though.Go out before you go full DirkNBA is a young man's game. The training camps, all the traveling, multiple games in a week etc. A lot of wear and tear on the body. Wade lives for moments like this.   I bet Nowitzki and Wade still love the adoration from the fans especially when they make a big play. That shit never gets old, but the other aspects of being an NBA player definitely does.   Nowitzki and Wade probably would play another 5 years if they could skip the other things and just be in the last 5 minutes of big playoff games for the adrenaline rush lol. Better to burn out than fade away.  What else would you expect from the Heat? Shout out #MambaMentalityReal recognize real. Imagine Kobe yelling ‚ÄúKobe‚Äùlooked to at least be in rhythm, just smothered.  wade's shot is just 100% aimbot hacksPls come back KD has been great, but over the last 10-15 games he‚Äôs been absolutely bricking free throws :) welcome to the ELITE secret reddit clubs lol. (not that anything really happens there).there are a weirdly large amount of cavs legends for a team with one championship can i unread thisMan it is only been a year and I have forgotten all about Dwyane Wade being on the Cavs.Someone tell me if I‚Äôm wrong but most Dirk interviews I‚Äôve seen sound like he hasn‚Äôt fully committed to retirement yetLiterally bold Would love to see Vince as an honorary all-star Vince should play forever.

I love Wade, but let‚Äôs not pretend that he‚Äôs perfect.I disagree with this statement.Execept hereLiterally none? I LOVE D Wade, but a lot of people hate him for dirty plays over the years, Mavs fans hated him for the reenactment of 06. No one on earth has "literally no past mistakes to hate him for."Dislocated rondos shoulder. No hate I love d wade but that did happen. This is so true. Magic fan...yet I own 3 Wade jerseys.You're kidding, right? My favorite part is KD's reaction. Millions of dollars, one of the best in the game right now, and even his shoulders just slumped straight down.  Buzzer beaters are just the best and the worst lmaoI was in a 3 on 3 once and this old dude hit an off balanced shot he just chunked up and it banked off and went in to put us out of the tourney   I was so heated I punted the ball and haven't played competitive since Iggy on the receiving end of both Wow thank you for that Devin Harris clip. That might be the most difficult buzzer beater I've ever seenI've never seen that Mo Pete one. That's wild. Ruffin could've just held it i knew what the second one was as soon as i clicked the link. that one still hurts.From half court tooI still get triggered by this fucking shotAlso, no cornrows wasn't even a game winner either smhhttps://youtu.be/iJ_lQXTzL4o3 rings3-WadeWell it is going under water in the next couple decades so it could be the lost city of wade.[deleted]He jumped on the scorers table this game too. Imo it's the most badass thing you can do after hitting a buzzer beater at home."This is my house"   Dude was on fire that year. Best Wade season.NEVER LOSTWe ended up losing the 8th seed tiebreaker because of this shot. I'm biased towards my one because I watched it happen live.   teenager me was shook when that (Chicago) happened. [Got you](https://streamable.com/bnaoo)Greatest game winner in his last season.. it‚Äôll certainly be memorablethe interview at the end was so wholesome too, gonna break my heart at the end of the seasonCan‚Äôt even be mad I‚Äôm just happy to have a moment like this for his last season.now i can go to sleep with a smile on my face. thanks dwadejust smile? i fucking yelled it. My whole neighborhood found out.Yep I thought Warriors had it on the block, but then  he reloaded for probably the best dagger I've seen in years.  That was just damn impressive.Oh don‚Äôt worry fitz is salty in the postgame, such a tool THANK YOU! Pounded his chest and there was even a little king and everythingGod that just reminded me of Harden's. Absolutely 100% ball don't lie.Well you're (arguably) the hardest team to beat, so it makes it that much more impressive.Awwwee. Biiiitch :,)I said < _ < > _ > biiiiiiiiiiitchThat shot of Curry and Cook in awe was hilariousImma need a sauce on thatFor sure that's the first one that came to mind. He's had a few good ones but that one's the best imo. can i have a link fam?Exactly. That game was legendaryhttps://youtu.be/Y63BK1IEmOwI would agree, especially with double OT  but tonight's was against a better  team talent wise. Hard to decide, both are pretty damn great.Kelly Olynyk in the parking lot begging for him to join the HeatKid to the heat its confirmed [D-Wade got the best this time.](https://youtu.be/wNjQishYOy0)If Harden had not made that game winner then I guarantee that KD no-call would have been a top 5 worst no-call in sports. We all know what the number one no-call in sports history is....Don‚Äôt forget that if Harden didn‚Äôt make it, they would‚Äôve lost the game to KD‚Äôs out of Oracle Arena save.Father Prime with the executionGet blocked and then bank it. Don't question me, who do you think you are, Dwayne Wade or somethingKD gave a look of pleasant surprise That was some insane harlem globetrotters level shot. All you can do is shrug and laugh it off.   The Warriors blocked his first shot and played really good defense, no it's not like they made it easy or anything. sums up this years league tbh. craziest game winner of they year.. warriors in 5.So nice that he kept his left foot down and ended up winning it. There already bruhDidnt take longAnd Lebron that one time when he was on the heat too.Yeah that was insane. I hate injuriesAnd those knees aren't getting any better. Maybe he wants to walk without a cane at 50 years old.That's a pretty darn good reason LOLYou either retire a hero, or die a Melo.Yeah him and Gab have been trying to have kids forever to no avail, they finally got a surrogate and seeing those two with their daughter all the time on their social media lets you know why he's doing it. He finally has a kid with her and he wants to spend as much time as possible with themHe could retire tonight and I wouldn‚Äôt be mad. Perfect way to go out lmaoKD to LA confirmed?Which is hilarious because over the month of February, he's shooting 80% which is normally quite reasonable. It's just that he's averaging 89% on the year which makes his 80% look unacceptable. Getting ready to join the Lakers?hey all 32 subscribers.... the shitty illuminati is what i would have gone with.Cavs legend Isiah Thomas He hasn't said he's retiring. But the league is like "dude get the hint, you can barely walk"That was the impression i had! He doesnt seem like his heart is really set on being done. [deleted]The iPhone as I‚Äôm sure most smart phones can enable different keyboards for different languages.I‚Äôm high and this made me laugh a lot thank youHold down n for √± Dwayne 'Latrell Sprewell' WadeWhen was that???? been a heater all my life, somehow this passed me  &#x200B;Had to watch this after thinking it was a scrap. Ending up being just a verbal confrontation. Dwayne wade is still PURE. You haven't played since because you were suspended indefinitely for kicking the ball. You know what you did!wade did it for his boy cp3  pls banana boat boys..all of you one year.  do it for the memes, do it with a stink eye the whole time at dubs.Wade joining the super exclusive "Devin Harris and Mo Pete" club. Not many can do that.It's Jeff Malone for me (at least in the NBA)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-8hvhKmEo0  Devin Harris' shot is as exceptional as it gets but I just can't even comprehend the shot mechanics and physics behind that Jeff Malone game winner. I can see someone with quick hands finding touch on that Devin Harris buzzer beater one in a million but Jeff Malone game winner feels near impossible. I actually wouldn't believe it happened if somebody accurately told a story of it but if we had no footage of the shot.  edit:  Also that famous Ralph Sampson series-winning game winner in 1986 WCF Game 5 is worth a mention imo. It might not be as crazy as Jeff Malone's shot but it's a buzzer beating series winner in WCF. Plus, I can't really comprehend the shot mechanics on that too. It doesn't feel as impossible as Jeff Malone shot but to find the touch on that position while your body is going to different directions and your shot release looks like a volleyball pass is insane to me.   A high quality footage of it here 15 seconds in although I imagine most people saw it:  https://youtu.be/EVjl0QRkLoI?t=15Hindsight is 20/20From memory the game had significant playoff seeding implications Astute observation. People forget thatSo farHe can just keep making a new one every year.Especially when you‚Äôre good enough to say it‚Äôs my houseYeah that was a painful moment.  But it was NBA history before my eyes so it was ok and I can respect it. I need to see a photo of him on top if that boothThat one against the Bulls was crazy too. "Heat Nation, I love y'all"  and that's when my dick and my eyes started wateringHave a link to it? I closed my stream before the interviewGot one more ‚Äú This is my house‚Äù moment üò¢Yeah this is sick. In front of the home crowd tooYeah, this is something I'll definitely remember for a while hahaHe's been driving me absolutely nuts lately. Just non-stop whining about the 3-point percentage when the Warriors are down.[deleted]But Garry St Jean is a consummate pro with this joyousness that just makes you smile so it balances out Fuck your username is so good I'm actually mad. Hardens was betterYou can drop the arguably*Hey, it's you guys!* Oh my God I remember watching that live. "This is my house!"https://youtu.be/DovAA3EJkIs  I had to go look too, I'd be surprised if he did this twice and this is the wrong linkYall hair look so differentThe next chapter Luke Walton looked up at the stars and said ‚Äúwow the greatest 3 in the world just beat the warriors, wow‚ÄùThe D made him pass on a 3, then pass on a 2, then pass to someone else, then forced a pump fake, then blocked his shit....only for him to fade back and to the left off the wrong foot, just tossing to ball up on a prayer.  Unrealthis. why would he play? he can probably land a sick job even after he retires considering how charismatic he is. not like his grandkids arent set for life already. he aint winning shit in miami and he has no reason to ringchase either, he already has a statue, first ballot, retired jersey and the utmost respect and love of an entire city.Dont let the old school players hear you say that! Everyone knows you gotta play till your knees sound like a bowl of rice krispies. Wholesome Never gonna top Cavs legend Antoine Walker or Shaq imoChuck Daly would have killed Isiah if he went to a division rivalYeah, I have loved Dirk since I was a little kid, but it hurts to see him barely being able to move now. He needs to become a coach instead or somethingYeah I see him go up and down the court so slowly and he looks like he's in so much pain. Definitely time to retire even though he's not ready. Here we fucking go boyes, TO THE MOONYou can also just hold down the ‚Äòn‚Äô to get a list of alternate letters like that. It works with other too, mostly the vowels.Better yet if you google "√±" it's the first results.Co√±o! Learn something new everyday. Thanks.It was during Game 3 of the Heat-Pacers series in 2012.  Honestly, it was really tame. Wade just got heated during a frustrating game where he couldnt sink anything and Spo called him on it during a timeout. I remember he snapped his arm away from Spo and some teammates stepped in to keep it from escalating. He did the classic turn around mid walkaway and walked back towards Spo but there were tons of teammates between them, and that was that.   ESPN didn't shut up about it for a week after that and the rumor mill spun hard.RIP headphone usersI had never seen that before, thank you. I can't comprehend how he pulled that off. if you watch that 2nd one in slo-mo, it's amusing to watch the bystanders as more and more of them take in what's happeningDamn, both are insane. Malone didn't have a defender though. Reminds me of Roberto Carlos' soccer goal lolHe would be the goat if he somehow leads the heat to a ring this year and retiresNot one. Not two. Not threeI believe he does[This is *HIS* house](https://imgur.com/gallery/5CGp1Ec)‚ÄúThis is *my* house.‚ÄùMight wanna see a doctor about that but I understand hey nothing wrong with letting the bald man cryand on that dope court, it's perfect.IN THE VICE JERSEYRight? Every time it‚Äôs ‚Äúokay so you‚Äôve got the 23rd best three-point shooting team IN THE LEAGUE, out-shooting a team with three of the greatest shooters OF ALL TIME‚Äù x25Jim Barnett is a national treasure and will be treated as such. Great former player, sweet old man, knowledgeable and fair. But yes, fitz is a bridge troll.We don‚Äôt deserve the Saintly One. I'm so glad I got to watch that game. I also told my friend (who's a huge Warriors fan) like 2 minutes earlier that Harden was gonna make a dagger 3 to win it. The Warriors had hit their lowest point of the season due to the KD/Draymond fiasco and people were ready to dismiss them for the rest of the season, and then Harden does that to make matters worse... even though they immediately got their shit together after that, almost like it woke up a beast haha.  Also he was definitely fouled too.Definitely arguable in the regular season due to the coast.LeBron had his best season ever that year, in terms of individual and team dominance, and a loooot of people still thought d-wade was flat out robbed of mvp. that should tell you how good he was that year.Wow that was so fuckin coolThere you go!dude will probably never pay for a drink again in miamiGot to save his strength and stamina to eat assIndeed, quit while you're still on topWhen Doc gave him that slightly awkward send-off over the might, I couldn't help but feel like he was trying to pressure Dirk into committing to retirement so he didn't have to deal with him anymore Even his already slow and unconventional shot seems to take an extra second to full form.√ëicennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnope, doesn't work for me.Fuck whoever downvoted youoh yeahhhhh! Dude, I was in INDY for all those games, made it to every one. It was gloriousESPN will turn any little thing into a week-long debate on every single show and Sportscenter segment. I love the afternoon bloc of The Jump/HQ/ATH/PTI (High Noon is aight), but I do get kind of tired whenever each show talks about the same 3 or 4 stories and gives their takes. Although I do love to hear each panelist's take on Around the Horn because they're some of the best and most diverse in sports journalism. And sometimes Dan Lebatard will make fun of the topics and take a shot at the network/Disney for making them talk about ridiculous headlines. I like how he doesn't take his own show very seriously, which is obvious by the fact that his dad is on there haha.I wonder what the thought process is among people who edit videos like that. "You know what would go great at the beginning of this NBA highlight video? A deafeningly loud five second blast of electronic music."I love watching replays of huge shots/scores and seeing the crowd react. Every different angle I always look at a different section of the crowd.Malone had a defender but he didn't contest the shot. And I can't really blame him, how can you contest that shot lmao?Could you imagineHe managed to get Shaq another ring, so there is literally nothing that can stop him.Incorrect. I made em in bulk all at once he's literally had the last 4 super bowls with that username he's a daily in here n r/nfl[Bah Gawd ](https://i.imgur.com/1uanh0d.jpg)Awesome!

I had to mute part of tonights game because of how obnoxious fitz was. But anyone who disses JB is gonna catch some handsWe got a fucking squad now If Dwyane walked into a store I was working at I would let him take whatever he wants idcI mean, he's stupid rich. He can probably afford to buy most of the bars he goes to.Bet Dwade is an amazing tipper.Dude needs to be in peak physical condition to handle Gab's assI heavily doubt he cares about having to deal with dirk. He‚Äôs no threat to anybody on the court anymore.Doc tried to honor a legend because he wasn‚Äôt sure if he was coming back or not. Everyone wants to scrutinize that because like you said it was awkward. I personally think it looked awkward because doc didn‚Äôt plan it and no one knew what the hell he was trying to do right away. Tha√±ksHaters are everywhere. I literally can't. If he does I'll record myself eating a well balanced meal and post it in this sub.My body is readyThere's so much joy in every corner of this photo, and then this guy is just so proud. Warms my heartIs that my dad?Yes, but it‚Äôs not about the cost, it‚Äôs about the love and respect Miami will give him for the rest of his life.

Can‚Äôt wait for the sequel! #CoachDirkClass act and great player, paved the way for a new generation and style of bigs in the NBA.DIRK I FUCKING LOVE YOU - YOU FUCKING BEAUTIFUL BASTARDHuh, I thought I was done shedding tears after his last two games.  Little did the fans know it before, but Dirk revealed in an interview with Mark Followill last season (Dirk's 20th) that he remembered and cherished when the fans cheered him on and gave him ovations whenever he entered the game in his rookie year, in which he struggled mightily.Loyal as fuck*THAT'S MY QUARTERBACK*His 2011 championship is one of the greatest runs ever: beating a decent Blazers team, beating Kobe, a young OKC core, and beating the villain that is the Heatles.All classBuild that statue RIGHT NOWThe post-it KD leaves in the Golden State locker room with a forwarding address won‚Äôt be as classy.Dirk ‚ÄúJust a kid from W√ºrzburg‚Äù NowitzkiI hope Giannis is this loyal because seeing him anywhere else would hurt so bad. Dallas won the lottery with 41No more cutting onions around here alrightWay back in the day when I was a kid and Dirk was pretty new in the league I used to write letters to my favorite basketball players and send a card asking for an autograph. I spent hours on each one as I drew on and colored the envelopes to look their jerseys. I had a fairly low response rate (as you might imagine) but Dirk was one of the few to get back to me. I probably annoyed any kid or adult who I talked to for the next 6 months as I carried that autographed card around with me (in a special holder) to show to everyone.   I‚Äôm married with a little kid now and I still have that card and it still has really happy  memories associated with it.   Dirk has always been a class act and has always given it all to the game.   Thanks for the memories, Dirk!!Dirk ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard‚Äù NowitzkiDirk caught so much shit from the national media up until he won that ring and he never got mad about it or made any pithy comments about the writers/commentators, as far as I can remember. Dirk was awesome just for that. I never thought much of him until these last few years when I began to appreciate just how different he was from the typical NBA athlete41rk NowitzkiPetition to make Dirk the new NBA logo.End of an era. Thank you, Wunderkind!Petition to make that silhouette into the new NBA logoThe wettest watermark of all time[Word cloud out of all the comments.](https://i.imgur.com/METBhcE.png)  Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. EnjoyDirk. Timmy. Hakeem. Texas cities have been fortunate with their NBA superstars.>So many memories. So many stories. They are not mine. They are ours.  Fuckin chills. And I'm not even a Mavs fan.I want to upvote but it‚Äôs at 41kI‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre cryingI hope this happens with more players - playing with one team their whole career.   Westbrook and Dame could be next to do it.  Giannis too.  Probably Steph.He deserves  a statue outside the arenaDirk and Steve is my favorite duo üñ§Definition of a class act. 10/10.Fuck man I didn't think I was gonna cry this morning...   DIRK FOREVER  Dallas just isn't Dallas without DirkI am not a Mavs fan. I'm barely an NBA fan and I must admit that this made me tear up a bit. What a beautiful connection to have with a whole city.D*41*lasThat silhouette. I'm going to miss him always making that shot and hating him for it. The I35 rivalry will never be the same.Disco DIRKI wonder his job title will be while he collects checks from Cuban to make up for all the money he left on the table in his career.OP‚Äôs not relevant user name...I miss him already :(41.21.1 we are forever grateful.How do you think something like this works money-wise for the paper when players do this.   You could argue that this would actually be a selling point for your paper, so you give the player a free page to do this because it's a pretty great advertisement and you'll likely see a significant uptick in sales that day.   Or do you just charge full price anyway and hope the player is willing to pay up.Dirk taught an entire generation of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex about commitment and dedication in the easiest way to learn, by example. Thank you Dirk for being the hero that North Texas needed rather than the one we deserved.man i love dirk.New NBA logo anyone?I‚Äôm not much of a basketball guy, but I love seeing stuff like this. A genuine, heartfelt message like this to the fans is, to me, the sign of a true legend. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre the best ever or if you‚Äôre even the best right now. Sports aren‚Äôt just about competition and breaking records. Sports are about being a part of a community where everyone loves the game, loves their team, and loves the players. Players and fans alike share the thrill of victory and the sting of defeat. We are in it together.   Seeing stuff like this reminds me of growing up in San Diego and watching local heroes like Tony Gwynn and Junior Seau end their careers with honor and grace.*cries in GermanI'm not crying youre cryingMight be the best career in NBA history if you take absolutely everything into account. Good game, Dirk.This is how you superstar.That's GOAT level.One of the greatest to ever play the game.   He always was a hard worker and had some big challenges to overcome when he came to the US.  As a German he's the reason why I started following the mavs, I won't call me a mavs fan because I've been a dirk fan but it feels like I will stick with that team, I don't follow the NBA as much as I used to but I always check the mavs scores and I can't imagine that to change.   Back in the day when I was in school I could watch a ton of NBA and NHL, nowadays I only manage to watch NFL live.  But during that championship run i watched a ton of regular season and almost every play off game it was fantastic to see dirk and all the other great players beat each and everyone. The games were so intense and nobody really believed that they would win it all.   It was the one chance that Dirk and the Mavs got and they went for it, I was truly happy for him and the whole organisation.   Dirk might be the most honous and humble character to ever make it this far, to see how he and Cuban worked together to create competitive teams was amazing and eye opening.  Dirk stood back so many times and sacrificed so much, giving it all while he could demand so much.   A true role model and if I could ever meet one celebrity I'd pick him because I could truly learn a lot from a an amazing character like himshould have been 2 championships. refs planDownvote me into infinity. I don't care.  Dirk's one ring is worth more than any amount of rings some other players will ever get.Reminds me of those handouts Kobe had made for the first home game after he announced he was retiring.right in the feels damI'm not crying. It's just been raining on my face.Hell the newspaper probably printed that for free just for him. Great player and person.Did he just throw shade at Kawhi lolPure classThat is one classy, step-back, one-legged jimbo of a guy. Much love, Dirk. Thanks for the memories.Now he can go back to playing the [drums](https://youtu.be/655rRkQ7RpY)THANK YOUTHANK YOUThere will never be another Dirk. Thanks for everythingThe next chapter: finally getting all the payouts I took backTHANK YOUI think everyone forgot to follow OP‚Äôs instructions. READ WITH SARCASM.   Changes everything.Dirk‚Äôs full page thank you is more meaningful than KD‚Äôs ringsThats a hell of a letter.  Amazing he stayed with one team.  I hope we eventually get one of these from Booker.  Including the championship mention.  ;)Dirk for Governor!I‚Äôm a lifelong Laker fan but have always love Dirk, what a legend.What a guy. Forever a legendI‚Äôm not even a big NBA fan and I thought that was really touching.Literal goosebumpsNowitzki: Fine German HopsI won‚Äôt be shocked if Cuban brings him on as a rep for the MavsGonna miss that guy waddling down the court.  Atleast we have some other solid players now.  Pretty cool to see this at the top of /r/allMaybe he becomes the next NBA icon if they ever update it. The dude is an absolute ambassador for the sport.Did an atomic bomb permanently cast that poor man's shadow into that letter? This is a horrible tragedy. #neverforgetDirk played the game the right way. Went to work and didn‚Äôt complain. Was a model for the kids and community. Have everything on and off the court for Dallas.  He even took pay-cuts and never requested those max contracts like other players. (Yes, he got paid later on but that‚Äôs after years of lower salaries) He wanted to win and that‚Äôs all that mattered. We will miss that jump-shotFull paged. Double spaced.   Just kidding.   Congrats on retirement!Straight up class41k upvotes right now. Brings a tear to my eyeKeep that.I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again.   Three point on a bitch like Dirk Nowitzki Up in the club like Dirk NowitzkiFucking dumb shit, making a grown man cry on Easter.Why am I crying in the club right now?Americans get Papers on a Sunday? Damn!Trying to figure out who started chopping onions at my family gatheringI'm not crying you're crying:( Thank you too!What a guy. What a legend.Thank you  jesus!Dirk about to get PAID! (by Cuban)Absolute legend\*cries in torontonese\* I love(d) you so much Dirkabsolute legend, one of the best everThe feels :(Im not crying, you are!Dirk is a real onea true goatSomeone show this to Giannis.. it's so special to spend your WHOLE CAREER in ONE CITY Giannis....anyone know his next role with the mavs? is it just shooting coach or higher up the chain?I used to have a Mavs shirt where half was Dirk's face and the other half was the team logo. No one could tell what it was. I miss those shirts. I miss Dirk.High quality dudeDang, that‚Äôs heavy.Class actMan, I remember when I was a bandwagon Spurs fan throughout the 2000s hating Dirk and the Mavs so much. They had great battles. Dirk is as good a guy as they come.I dont like basketball at all, not even a little but I love Dirk.If Dirk ever comes back as head coach for the Mavs, then that would be so dopeWhatever is making the universe go, may it bless Dirk in all his future endeavors. This is a one of kind person and player that should be revered forever. People of his caliber don't gain fame and attention too often and all should appreciate what he has done for the Mavs and the Dallas community. I am thankful for getting to experience Dirk and the effort he has given through out the years.I like how minimalistic he is, pure classso uh  is he retiring? some of those celebrations are going to look mighty awkward if not...When they beat the heat in the finals, I think I saw Dirk shirzeys that said 'Das Mavs' on the front. I wish I find one then? Because that is amazing. Now I'm sure it's gone forever.GOATI hope they use this image as his statue at the AACIconic fade-away etched in NBA history*cries in german*Must be nice to have your franchise‚Äôs GOAT play for one team his whole career :(THANK YOUClass actGotta love that watermarkWhy am I crying in da club right nowAwesome he was from Wurzberg?  I was born there !!For sure, but you gotta give a ton of credit to Dirk too. Dirk spent like what? Over 10 years in Dallas before they won the championship. So many players nowadays would be looking for greener pastures after just a few.Being loyal in business is tough, making it work for 21 years is impressive.They did not consider once to trade Dirk. Spurs actually tried to trade Duncan once, Lakers tried to trade Kobe. Franchise greats such as Ewing and Hakeem were traded in the end. Yeah Mavs front office is great.Gotta love the font and format, classic Dirk.Man voluntarily took pay cut so team has the cap space to recruit better player.you can‚Äôt hate this guy.Due to the size of Texas they always needed a superstar with a heart just as big. Dirk was that guy.THANK YOURight?! How can you dislike Dirk?I don‚Äôt know if any other player means more to a city like Dirk is for Dallas.Dirk is the FUCKING MAN! I really can't think of an athlete out of my city that I like so much. Maybe Steve Smith.A class act.I remember when Conan came to Dallas in between his NBC and TBS shows, he invited Dirk on stage and Dirk was such a fuckin champ. Also, I was at game 5 of the 2011 finals. Never have I ever heard such a loud arena.Incredible. Thanks for sharing!Didn't realize that was Nash. Nice.Nothing but respect for this guy, how can you dislike him even as fans of rivals?goddammitI'm not crying you're cryingThey did a nice job. Not a huge fan of the comic book type stuff (because he is a real super-hero to some) or the music on the video but I appreciate his greatness  This is still my favorite of the year. And I don‚Äôt even drink. https://youtu.be/TjXKS6ONtLQ  I legit cried.I don‚Äôt follow basketball. What exactly did he innovate?Yo someone make a post of all thirty teams‚Äô Jerry West like logos, I can guarantee you at least one upvoteSomeone on the Mavs sub actually made one.  https://i.redd.it/7gbkouuzffr21.jpgWe already know how Dirk's statue is going to look likeSo smooth. Every time he took that shot I was certain it was going in, and when it didnt I would just assume someone moved the hoop lol. One of the best fadeaways I've ever seen. Wish Tatum could learn to shoot like that I cringe when he does that contested step back deep 2.Blazers is just a tall guy on crutches.Holy shit though that's a good idea. I'd love to see one for each team.Would the knicks have an overweight Carmelo Anthony jab-stepping?This should be a thingI was just noticing the impact of that ‚Äúis dirk gonna fall over?‚Äù Fade-away silhouette. It looks sick here.Would be interesting to see each teams nba logoThe Mavs ring is at least worth 5 KD‚Äôsmajor chills!Respect you in the club at 10amYou guys should cherish him man not many people are so loyal. Truly an all time great, made the mavs relevant. If you're under a certain age and havent seen Dirk in his prime he was just unbelievable. I could watch that little fadeaway jump shot forever.   And the year he won the title--ive never seen the nba fan base so united.  Part of it was lebron was a villain but part of it we all wanted Dirk to get his ring. That team is probably one of the most likeable championship teams in recent memory to me. Just a bunch of guys and Dirk against Bosh, wade and James and somehow they pulled it off.   Im not that emotionally invested in sports but Dirk retiring really makes me sad man, even as a celtics fan. Hes just so loveable and nice and played the game the right way and was loyal and always positive never a bad moment. I'll miss him dearly.Making it rain through your tearsTim Duncan to David Robinson??  Steve Young to Joe Montana?? Luka pls.But for real, fuck the Colts for going from one generational QB talent to another immediately lol.Just healthierHopefully more the Aaron Rodgers to Brett Favre.I think they‚Äôll be in good hands with Luka and Kristaps for the next ten years. Dallas is certainly going to have a bright future.Yeah I don't want Luka to get seriously injured and miss an entire season due to it though.THANK YOURight? Lessons in this piece.He recently said in a German interview that in couple of years, he wants to be a coach/manager, where the goal is to guide young players throughout their careers. I think he wants to do what Holger did for him throughout his life."Dirk will return in Avengers: Endgame"Such a Dallas deep cut!Brandon Roy was the mavs killer.Also OKC with Durant, Westbrook, HardenNot just beating Kobe, *SWEEPING* Kobe when everyone expected another 3-peat.brandon roy was something else before his career got derailed :(And played with 102 fever during one of those gamesI was stationed there in the 90s. There was a big military base there. I wonder if he played ball with American kids from the Army base growing up. There was lots of basketball courts and before 9/11 the base was open to public.Mavs FO is always talking about putting to things in place to hijack Giannis, Cuban realizes how unbelievably stupid it was to overrule Donnie Nelson and move down instead of drafting Giannis.  I think he stays in Milwaukee, but if he does go somewhere else, it's gonna be Dallas.I would love those see those envelopes.I wrote him a letter once and he replied to me too! It was pretty sick.THANK YOUThat 2011 title was the ultimate fuck you to all the analysts that said he was too soft to play in the NBA and win.Every chucklefuck who ever harped on that "Dirk Nowinski" shit lol.Much Team CryingHe deserves a stature in his hometown too. I'm from W√ºrzburg as well and damn it. It would fit quite good when they placed it in front of the local Basketball stadium.Growing up in Dallas I was CRUSHED when that duo split. Imagine the possibilities...Not really a fan either... just thought this sub would enjoy.   I thought it was classy.He's already said he has a job for life and he can choose whatever he wants to do. I need that kind of boss lolThey cost three times as much and are full of advertisements.  Only in America.Wait, other places don't?  Sunday is the biggest (as in, the most content) paper of the week in the US.He announced his retirement on his last home gameCould've gone to a contender for his last ~3-4 years as well instead of playing for a team that's fighting for the 8th spot. But he chose to stay>So many players nowadays would be looking for greener pastures after just a few.  That's not the fault of players, it's the fault of teams and fans. There is literally zero benefit to staying loyal to a team now.   You could spend 9 years of your life dedicating yourself to a team leading them to successive better and better playoff results culminating in a ECF showing all to get thrown away like garbage the minute the team can get someone better. And the fans will go crazy for you when you win, but the minute you lose they turn on you and put pressure on teams to trade you.   And that is what happened to DeMar DeRozan. He wanted to be a lifer, he wanted to spend his career playing just for Toronto, took hits financially to play for Toronto, and was told he wouldn't be traded only to find out from the news of all things (instead of in person) that he was traded.   A player who wanted to dedicate his entire career to the team was traded for someone who has no real commitment to staying with the Raptors shows you exactly how much loyalty is valued by teams.   Why would any player ever be loyal to a team right now?His teams had multiple great seasons though. If we compare him with AD his teams never finish #1 in the West or have 50+ wins like Dirk‚Äôs teams did.This is why his Ship means so much more compared to üêç> Spurs actually tried to trade Duncan once  You're getting it mixed up. Duncan once thought about leaving in free agency but the Spurs definitely never tried trading him.The way he wrote ‚Äú41‚Äù looks awesome too!Kinda looks like a telegram, lol. Good shit from our man from Wurzburg22 friggin lines of text though. soo closeCan you explain to the uninformed Dirk fans why this font is ‚Äòclassic dirk?‚ÄôHis next chapter: finally getting the money he lost from pay cuts back lol Cuban bout to start writing fat chequesI dunno, Tom Brady did the same thing, and plenty of people still hate the manI thought that is JJ Watt                                                                 Edit:Am I wrong about JJ Watt is a big heart person or I'm being downvoted because I mentioned JJ Watt in r/nba?*DANKEDirk was the first 7 footer to shoot the 3. Before him guys his size were expected to take 90% of their shots within 10 feet of the basket. Dirk had the ability to ‚Äústretch‚Äù the floor by shooting at any distance and is largely credited for popularizing the position Stretch 4. Guys like Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis and Giannis have modeled their shooting after him. In 50 years when people look back at the game Dirk will be remembered as once of the sports most influential players.Let‚Äôs make a list of iconic logos per team to get someone a head startSomeone‚Äôs going to do it and I swear to god for harden they‚Äôll put him floppingI don't think every team has a player that's iconic enough... Even if you go across all sports, maybe there are enough signature moves, poses, key moments, but in the NBA alone? - it's difficult to imagine that every team has a player that would be recognizable enough to casual fans... I mean, it takes a really deep impression to be able to ID a silhouette. West, MJ, Dirk.. that's some tough company.Cavs: JR Smith throwing a bowl of soupThis is peak off-season stuffI‚Äôve already done a lot of em...filling the remaining teams is now on the to do list!r/NBAlogoProjectI saw this idea and made a quick draft of one before seeing your post. Mine's a little different so I'm gonna put it here anyway:  https://imgur.com/AT2VIAa[Something like this](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/6e/17/99/6e17990b3190dde9037213ecfa948f22--crazy-eyes-my-boys.jpg) I imagine.The leaning Dirk lmaoooAlso just had such a high arc. Was a thing of beautySilhouette of a knee exploding.Oh shitBowie or Oden?  Or both?Deandre Jordan just standing thereMight be an idea for a thread when I'm bored tomorrowIt‚Äôs worth infinite KDs. Dirk did it the right way.Bible club duhon the Lord's dayHey hey, dawg could be Australian.At berghein in honour of dirkThat championship only gets better as time goes on.  The Mavs swept the defending champion Lakers in crushing fashion, then beat the Heat in a series where they were built to take on the new-age superteam the Heat assembled.  As fans and the media care more and more about solely the number of rings a player has won to determine their legacy, we are going to see more and more superteams. The Mavs won that championship "honestly".The entire country was behind that Mavericks teamNot just that the man was loyal to the franchise, but the franchise was loyal to him  /CriesinITAs a Heat fan, losing that championship didn‚Äôt sting as much because at least I got see Dirk get a ring. Had it been Mavs vs anyone else I would‚Äôve been there rooting for them.As a Spurs fan he was one of those players I wanted to hate but just couldn‚Äôt. That jump shot of his was poetry in motion. Such a great player and a real class act. Respect.Aaron Rodgers to Brett Farve Lionel Messi to RonaldinhoMario Lemieux to Sidney CrosbyTo this day mother will argue the Colts after learning Peyton was going to be out just decided to go full trust the process that season to get Luck.Porzingus is the real deal.DANKEDANKE SCH√ñNHell yeah he was I dont think that many people know that Blazers team was legit. Brandon Roy almost knocked us out.And IbakaMost of the base is now part of the University.Unless the Bucks lose everyone this summer for some reason i dont see him leavingVisiting the in-laws for the holiday weekend but I‚Äôll check my b-ball card box bc I‚Äôm pretty sure there were a few I didn‚Äôt end up sending.   Another quick funny story on that note though. Recently (sometime within the last ~year) my mom sent me a text with a pic of an envelope that was addressed to me that had just come to my parents house (same house I grew up in). The handwriting for the address looked super familiar but I couldn‚Äôt put a finger on it.   I only lived ~hour away so the next weekend when my wife and I were visiting for dinner I opened the envelope.   Inside was an autographed card from Mike Bibby.   Turned out the reason that the handwriting was so familiar was because it was mine. The envelope was the self addressed stamped envelope I included with a letter to him....15 years ago.   Took him a while to get around to it but dammit that but blows me away that he (or whoever is in charge of that stuff for him) kept the letter around for that long instead of chucking it and still took the time to autograph the card and send back.HAHA  *tear*I love it, I‚Äôm a big fan of Dirk. I just thought your username was funny for this situation... lolDon‚Äôt we all haha.  Would be funny if he decided that he wanted to be like the catering manager for the team or something random like thatLol come on, you‚Äôre saying that like it‚Äôs the same paper as any other day of the week, but with more ads for 3x the price. The Sunday paper is a content beast that usually carries a given paper‚Äôs best feature writing. And now I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about a subscription for Sunday-only home delivery and the last thing I need is another subscription lolShit he had Kobe giving him a call in FA. That‚Äôs gotta be tempting no matter how loyal you areSe qued√≥.That's the same for ANY job. Jobs want loyalty but show zero in return.Blake Griffin, too.Yea but I think that is an extreme example I dont think a lot if teams are gonna be pulling that type of stuff for players dedicated to their cities and teamsWell that‚Äôs why the guy said loyalty all around. Great respect to the front office for not fucking up a really cool career. No one thinks someone is a bad person for choosing a team, or a GM is bad for trading. It‚Äôs just that when a team and player both align their interests and you see a career like dirk, duncan, etc it is a cool thing to see.He's definitely had some practiceAlso he writes the "1" the way american do.W√ºrzburg represent! W√ºrzburg girl here. We‚Äòre so proud of him. And kind of sad he‚Äòs apparently not coming back home.  Fine, keep him, Dallas :)COMUNICADO OFICIAL: DIRK NOWITZKIDallas. Stop.  We had a blast together. Stop.W√ºrzburg reporting in! Dirk is one of a kindIf you don‚Äôt count the salutation, which I think is fair, it‚Äôs 21.Because 21 isnt the end.Subtle. Understated. Simple. Old-School. Just like Dirk!His team of publicists and the graphic designer they hired knows his styleNowitzki, Dirk. Consultant. Salary - $25,000,000.00He better get a seat on Shark Tank.His wife‚Äôs net worth is $400 million. Tom Brady can play for free and it wouldn‚Äôt even matterTom brady kisses his son on the mouth so thats enough reasonDirk never needed to pimp his DN41 programLike most people who hate Brady have any real reason other than He makes their team look pedestrian.There's no perceived struggle with Brady's Patriots to the casual fan.  Dirk went from playoff choker to championship redemption.  Some fans prefer that narrative.No you're right, Texas is just that big. We got Dirk in the DFW, Tim Duncan in Central Texas, and JJ Watt for Houston and East TexasI‚Äôll rattle off some of the more iconic ones that come to mind.  Mavs - Dirk fade obviously, Lakers - can keep West (or go with Kareem or Kobe), Bulls - Air Jordan, Spurs - plenty to choose from but I‚Äôd kinda like to see George Gervin doing a finger roll, 76ers - Dr. J dunking or AI‚Äôs crossover, Rockets - Dreamshake, Celtics - Bird shooting? Im not sure what else would go here honestly, Warriors - Curry shooting, Kings - Big O (dribbling or dunking or something), Magic - Dwight or Shaq dunking, Heat - Wade doing pretty much anything lol, Knicks - Ewing‚Äôs fade  These are just some that come to mind. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing some obvious ones thoughFor Portland you could go Dame hitting that shot against Houston. But personally you gotta go with the Glide. It's too unique and iconic.[Iconic](https://imgur.com/gbLAlUk)  courtesy of /u/sim888Celtics - Pierce in a wheelchairPacers - Artest punching a fan  (sorry, couldn't resist)Houston would have to be Hakeem, or I riot.If they're putting the most iconic players for a team as the logo I don't think it'll be harden on it...Lol well lucky for you ppl won't get that chance to shit on him cause he's not you're most iconic guy, that'd be Hakeem.I was thinking that or just shooting from the lineHow many people even know that Jerry West was the model for the NBA logo, though?Shaq branded shoes feature a very recognizable silhouette of him dunking. I would also think LeBron's tomohawk is unique enough.Nailed it[Leaning Tower of Dirk](https://i.imgur.com/bQLLj28.png)[One of my favorite Dirk shots](https://youtu.be/vlmd7ljeYcA)Oh man lolBill Walton, Roy, Nurk, Wes Matthews, I can go on lol.No, KD chose the hardest road. He said so himself.I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really a right or wrong way.   But, the way he did it certainly would give the type of personal satisfaction that is unmatched.What kind of jams do they play in Bible club?smh these seeker sensitive churches taking it too farReading the Bible with strippers at the breakfast buffetKing James versionSunday Service**B**ible **D**iscussion **S**tudy **M**eetingI was in fucking awe of his domination in 2011. It was other worldly. I'll miss that man. I feel like an era has truly ended for me now that Kobe, Duncan, Ginobili, and Dirk are gone along with Wade.that Mavs team was basically a textbook Hollywood "veteran bunch on their last mission" redemption story.  not only Dirk facing his old enemy from 2006, but also Kidd, Jason Terry, Marion, Peja getting their ring and all playing their part in the playoff run.  its so perfect that its almost cheesy.That loss was crushing, but glad it went to Dirk.Not to mention the series against an OKC team with three MVPs (albeit they would later become MVPs)It's the only time I can recall something like that happening in my lifetime.I know Montana and Young are both in the hall of fame, with Montana having a pretty solid argument behind him for GOAT status, but Messi to Ronaldinho feels like an even better passing of the torch.Quincey Carter to Troy Aikman. Troy Hambrick to Emmitt Smith.Steven Gerrard to Jordan Henderson üôèüèªThat‚Äôs exactly what they did, lol. I hate to do Curtis Painter dirty like that but idk how you could argue otherwiseTHANK YOU   -kawhi LeonardChaka KhanEven if the Bucks lose everyone, they'd be dumb to let go of Giannis.I hope he takes over social media for the team. Not because the current folks doing it aren't doing a good job, but damn that would be funny if the official Mavs Twitter/FB just started calling everyone in the league burgersI remember Kobe was like "I know the answer, but I still have to ask"And future employers expect candidates to explain job movement. I'm like, "Bitch, explain the fucking vacancy."a little bit different, but IT as wellReally? We traded Boogie after telling him we wouldn‚Äôt. The Thunder traded Harden for K Mart. The Clippers traded Blake and CP3. The Warriors traded Monta Ellis for Bogut. The Knicks just traded KP. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty more examples, but cmon. Tony Parker is playing for Charlotte for God‚Äôs sake  Edit: don‚Äôt forget about Isaiah ThomasMan if it was me I'd start with signature and probably have to do it like 20 times to get just right then I'd throw it in the printer to get the actual letter part on there last lol.What is the European way? With the"head" thing on top?He's a great ambassador for your city. Such a genuinely good guy.Didn't you read it? He's already home.You come visit. He's like both ours, but we'll just keep him here.Damn.  This spoke to me.Cuban may have hired them, but no way Dirk did. He never even had an agent./hourHe's a dead beat dadAnd even asks for a better kiss when the kid just pecks him on the mouth lmao who does that manI want to downvote you but that made me laughDo...do people do that???

This is it. He‚Äôs great and people are too salty to admit it a lot of times. I say we sit back and appreciate that we got to be alive while he was doing what he‚Äôs doing.I'm sure Knicks, Pistons, and Jazz fans from 90s hated Jordan for the same reason.I mean, the guy seems like a grade A douche.Brady was a god damn 6th round pickPretty sure our fan base would rather have T-Mac or Penny... but I‚Äôd be ok with Shaq.Pacers legend lance stephenson blowing LeBron JamesWhat about Manu's eurostep for the spurs?I feel weird saying dame would be our logo boy, but I feel as if he‚Äôs the most deserving.

Up there with the Sky Hook and he Dream Shake in the history of moves, we are lucky to have witnessed it for so many years.That was a solid contest by a great 6‚Äô11 defender in Bosh and Dirk looked so casual about it. BeautyIt blows my mind that Chris bosh never took a look at Dirks game and thought ‚ÄúHuh...if I just take literally a full step back I could be in a different class of players.‚Äù It sucks that he got sidelined right as he was realizing that (only 5+ years too late)Snake is the hardest road?Veggietales sonHall-e-Luka!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE23ajVX930Die LitVery generic sounding songs  I say this as someone who attends service every weekKJ52 broKanye Sunday ServiceCreedDirk and D-Wade both retiring pretty much signals the end of 2000s basketball. End of an era indeed.KG!He willed his team to victory. Just refused to be beat.This ain't it chiefExactly. That was how Kobe phrased it. I'm glad they ended up spending their careers on one team.Tell em you were promoted.Wellllll..... when you put it like that then ya I see what you meanCP3 asked for a trade. KP asked for a trade. TP signed as a FA. Not sure the Ellis situation. Harden they chose Ibaka over. 2 solid examples on your end, the rest are suspectyes, although most people don't use the head when writing fast. like we don't cross the 7 and the 0, even though we should.Ambassodor for germany.. oppsite to hitler.. half german half american here. Personally im am sick of people connecting people with our nazi past in the first place. Great to have such a kind loving guy representing us and humanity in the first place.  Dirk for presidentYeah that‚Äòs what he‚Äòs telling you guys ;) His parents still live here though and he visits often.He never had an agent?! That might be the coolest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. What a badass.[citation needed]Donald Trump, for starters.I didn‚Äôt wake up thinking I was going to spit take coke at work. But thanks to your comment I haveIs there an age that would make it not weird?I'm a bit older. So my friends in their 30s stop kissing their kids on the mouth when they're 8ish. However, I have a few friends in the UK and I made in Germany when I lived there for a bit. We're talking a mid 40s overweight man kissing his senior father on the mouth. I seen it a fair bit over there. Just a culture thing I guess.   Still weird to me to kiss your parent on the mouth regardless of age and I'm not a prude. Just feel like mouth to mouth kisses are for your partner(s)[Here's a gif of it](https://imgur.com/gallery/6npuQ9H)  There's another pic somewhere of him kissing his son on the lips tooI‚Äôm from Cleveland and I‚Äôm a fan of Brady, a fan of him retiring next year.Same. Also a fan of him cause he is still a niner fan sort of and still says montana is the goatI'm no fan of Brady, but this is an excellent point.Just gonna follow that up with a good bit of his pre-draft scouting report   >Negatives:¬†Poor build. Very skinny and narrow. Ended the ‚Äô99 season weighing 195 pounds and still looks like a rail at 211. Looks a little frail and lacks great physical stature and strength. Can get pushed down more easily than you‚Äôd like. Lacks mobility and ability to avoid the rush. Lacks a really strong arm. Can‚Äôt drive the ball down the field and does not throw a really tight spiral. System-type player who can get exposed if he must ad-lib and do things on his own.  >Summary:¬†Is not what you‚Äôre looking for in terms of physical stature, strength, arm strength and mobility, but he has the intangibles and production and showed great Griese-like improvement as a senior. Could make it in the right system but will not be for everyone.  But yeah everything was handed to him on a silver spoon like that other guy said. Especially his career. Didn't earn that at all. Nope.Who won a Super Bowl almost as soon as he became the starter. Dirk took years to win one title while Brady has 6 like he owns the Comissioner.Isn't the famous shaq logo, from his Magic days?  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fHtDjCNQ_D4/maxresdefault.jpgShaq breaking glass or dwight supermanT-Mac was the man. ONLY players shoes I ever owned.  7th grade C team basketball starter.Phrasing?Blowing his what.I know it‚Äôs not an in-game image but I was thinking Tim Duncan‚Äôs pregame ball hug but I don‚Äôt know how that translates in an outline. https://m.imgur.com/t/gaming/TIbZ5I think whatever it is, it has to be Tim DuncanNah Manu slapping the batB-Roy‚Äôs 40 footer would be pretty awesome if that Big 3 didn‚Äôt crumble from injuries, easily could have had a title. Maybe something from the Dallas come back game 10 years ago in the playoffs.   For sure I would go for that Dame shot. Clyde is 30 years away and never got us over the hump so just for the new generation dame is the future and brightest hope plus the best ambassador for Portland.   I can still remember that shot. Home alone with my brother, I had just been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer so I watched upstairs next to the toilet alternating between wishing for the blazers to win, crying and throwing up lol. My tv was ahead of the one downstairs so as soon as that ball went in, everything just disappeared.   I started screaming and ran downstairs as fast as I could and my brother is frantically asking what happened and I just could only point to the tv like just watch. Then to watch it again, it was so beautiful and perfect we were jumping up and down hugging when Lillard grabbed the mic and dropped the RIP CITY BABY.   I can still picture everything like it just happened that‚Äôs how influential that shot wasThe two that immediately came to mind would be dame's .9 shot or [clyde's super long glide dunk.](https://youtu.be/cVZhRBlvf_s?t=5)clyde drexler  https://i.imgur.com/hOlk24X.jpgIt'd definitely be Clyde going up for a dunk. God, I was spoiled to see that team growing up.[The piece this article is referencing](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/what-the-hell-happened-to-darius-miles) is an amazing read. His story in his own wordsThe BlockI was thinking when he threw the powder in the air. I know it‚Äôs not a b-ball move but it was iconic.Bring back short shortsHakeemI think I see why Magic guy liked the first one better.I don't get why Durant doesn't make this his #1 go to move too. He's got the same length, greater vertical, and every bit the shooter's touch Dirk had.Yeah, did you not see dbz?*Why do you need a hairbrush? You don't have any hair!*Some veggies went to sea sea sea to see what they could see see see but all that they could see see see was the bottom of the deep bulr sea sea seaVince Carter would like to have a word.Tim, Kobe, Dirk. It was an honor to have those three run the league for as long as they did. I'm sure Lakers, Mavs, and Spurs fans have a respect for one another's lifer stars because we all know how much that mattered to each of us.kobe was pretty close to leaving.  wonder if dirk was ever close thoughDonald Trump is definitely a peckerTom Brady still kisses his dad on the mouth.Thank you!! Some of my friends were saying that it wasn't weird, like...I'm sorry that you're objectively wrong and grossWhat‚Äôs the big deal? I kiss your mom on the mouth all the time.Ok I was prepared to say kissing your kid on the lips is normal but he looks like a teenager, that's creepy as fuck.What the fuckkThat is really creepy. Like that's a very long peck on the lips.Oh dear.  That is super weird.What the fuck  My mom kissed me on the lips when I was a kid, even up to about that age I‚Äôd say, though they were always pecks and never my Dad.  Yep that‚Äôs weird. Maybe it‚Äôs because Gisele is Brazilian? Any Brazilians know if this is normal in Brazilian culture?ZING!I think the issue honestly is that most people are too young to remember how big of an underdog that pats team was in their first super bowl. They beat the Greatest Show on Turf in a miracle super bowl after their starter went down for the entire season. Led by a 6th round pick no one knew anything about, they clawed their way to a Lombardi.  I‚Äôm like 25 now and watching that super bowl is my first big sports memory. If I wasn‚Äôt a NE sports fan from a young age then I would likely not even remember all that if I was 30 at this point... I‚Äôd just know the patriots as the best team. So don‚Äôt judge people for that. Being over 30 is pretty rare on redditYeah so you are admitting a guy picked 199 in round 6 who was 4th on the depth chart was picked to be the starter and then immediately had such an impact that he helped win a super bowl.It sure isHis ankles look super fragile.Pacers legend Lance Stephenson molesting LeBron James with his mouthHe knows what he didLove this one.  I‚Äôd like to see Manu‚Äôs block on Harden too.Timmy hugging Manu's headD Robinson isn‚Äôt out of the question, but yeah Duncan.Tim Duncan sitting on the bench slightly chuckling and getting a technical for itTimmy cradling the ball in front of his crotch on the free-throw line, like it‚Äôs his nutsack.Why not Pop? :DTim preforming a picture perfect by the book layup off the backboard> Clyde is 30 years away and never got us over the hump  he's been to the finals and took a couple games off Jordan, that's pretty gooddude good for you. I love shit like this. This is what dame does for people and it‚Äôs unbelievable. Such an amazing role modelYou‚Äôre in remission I hope?Gets these days just forget how important Hakeem was. Dude was one of the best finesse big men ever.I think Durant is more thinking about team offense, believe it or not. By attacking the way he does it really stresses the entire defense, opening better shots.No hair? What does this mean? What will become of him? What will become of his hairbrush? Let's find out.Where is my water buffalo?I don't understand how he's still going.Half man. Half amazing. It was a prophecy, not a nickname.John Stockton didn't win any rings, but I also give mad respect for sticking with the Jazz and for being very fundamental like Timmy. No one's touching his assists and steals records.Is Dirk slightly higher than Kobe and Tim in terms of being a lifer? I've heard Kobe wanted a trade at one point, and Timmy almost joined the Magic. But did Dirk ever even come close to leaving? Genuinely asking, I was not as big of an NBA fan in the early-mid 2000sI really hope Dame stays the same. He seems really content staying in Portland and I think they love him. He‚Äôs not had incredible amounts of success there but they‚Äôre a playoff team every single year aside from his first 2 years.   Curry too. I think those two are the most likely to be the next players to stick it out with one team. Russ too.As a WOLVES fan I'm so jealous. I wish we could've kept KG and hope that we'll somehow retain KATAggressively.You promised me a game rental from Blockbuster! I'm still waiting... You're a liar like all the rest of them.the kid wipes his lips off afterwards toSpecially since he's gettin one rubbed out. A cramp I mean.People were so hype on the Patriots. North Eastern Team Underdog named Patriots make it to the Super Bowl following 9/11 led by a sixth round nobody. Then they did it again and people were fucking going crazy over the Pats.  Then they did it again. And again. And again. That fucking team started out as a miracle, but damn near 20 years later and nobody remembers how fun and interesting they were starting off.Never skip Ankle WednesdaysLOLOne of?Yeah naw he‚Äôs the best. Hands down.I guess he also gets trapped and double teamed a lot more than Dirk ever did too, because he's a more versatile threat. No one can guard either guy in isolation though.Cebuuuuuuuuu100 pushups  100 situps  100 squats  and 10km run everyday.Same way Frank Gore is still going. He just keeps showing up.Dirk is one of my favorites ever. Tim, Kobe, bron, magic but he just always seemed cool as fuck and could hit any shot on the floorall time great passer and biased as fuck home stats crew. That one is for eternity.Reggie tooNo. A little indecisiveness doesn‚Äôt make up for the discrepancy in accomplishments. Kobe and Tim are top 10 greats.Ultimately, I think as long as they didn't actually leave, thinking about leaving doesn't take much away from their status as lifers. I guess you could make a case for Kobe, since he did request a trade so technically he did make his decision to leave. But as far as Tim looking at his options during free agency, he made the choice *not* to leave. Considering Orlando doesn't make a difference IMOWell I feel he is top but it's subjective so I give room for others. The only time I don't give room in sports discussion like that is when we talk about the GOAT, who will always be Gretzky.Lmao gang gangUnderrated comment made me laugh lmaoWhat‚Äòs Tim‚Äòs full name? I‚Äòm not American and only started watching basketball last season, so I‚Äòd love to know more about him. Must have been a great player since he‚Äòs mentioned among those other names.I said in terms of being a lifer because I wasn't talking about basketball skill. The guy I responded to grouped them all together because they were stars that stayed with one team, and I was proposing that Dirk might be above them as far as loyalty goesIsn't the GOAT Michael Scott? That's where Gretzky got all of his quotes.
r/nba,He already:  Demonstrated value by playing amazing basketball since his first game in the NBA   Engaged them physically by spending his first 7 years playing with them and taking them to their first finals  Nurtured their dependence by assembling a team that depended on him to be successful (just look how the same team that won 60+ games in 09 became a lottery team a year later)  Neglected them emotionally with The Decision   Inspired hope by coming back and winning them their first championship  now all that‚Äôs left is to...  Separate entirely  Edit: Whoever gilded this, thank you! You are a real golden god!!! IT getting all buddy buddy with dan gilbert so he can   Move in  After  CompletionDamn. The D.E.N.N.I.S.

"That's exactly right Kevin, you are really pickin up on this. i'm proud of ya"  "Ok there is no way that team is gonna come back to you after what you just put them through"  "Oh i could absolutely get that team back any time i want, i just choose not to"  "I one hundred percent guarantee you this team is finished with you"  "Well, i take that as challenge r/nba an i accept that challenge, i'll have that team back by the end of my contract"  "Yeah r/nba, you just don't get it, this is what stars do. THIS IS WHAT STARS DO"   "THIS IS BANANA BOAT STUFF" It's not about going to the Warriors. It's about *the implication* of going to the WarriorsBefore you know it, he's taking Dan Gilbert out on a boat.I'M HERE FOR THE SCRAPSThis is the truest thing I‚Äôve ever read. Once he separates entirely he will have completed the D.E.N.N.I.S. System, thus having Cleveland‚Äôs undying love. This paves the way for Lebron to return, on his own accord, and become the owner of the Cavaliers. #LEBRON HAS NOT EVEN BEGUN TO PEAK[For anyone else that didnt get the reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbvk4DNvvn0)Look like a goldfish  Underutilize Kevin Love  Expel rings from mouth LEBRON IS THE GOLDEN GOD[deleted]Oh whoops oh.

Season 8 though. Those last 3 episodes are god mode. HELLING YES. Just about every episode is a classicI would have to agree. Seasons 2-5 is the sweet spot.@'d! Season 4 has some words for youThe first 5 seasons are all masterpieces. Season 4 gets the edge for me when you count the live performances of the Nightman Cometh.I always thought The Nightman Cometh was slightly overrated, still really good.

I feel good today 6.25 STARS IN OSAKA-JO HALLOh man I'm nervously optimistic. Praying NBC has learned from their past mistakes, and hasn't neutered him.  If he plays this character like it SHOULD be played then this show has really high potential  Edit: just watched it, was pretty enjoyable, I'll definitely be watching it as it airs. You can still tell it's a network TV comedy, and it'll never touch the brilliance of Always Sunny, but it's a fun show, and was a great way to spend 20 minutes.*Clippers overhears and stares at Lebron*   Bron: Well don't look at me, you certainly wouldn't be in any danger.That's how Tristan and JR got their contracts...because of the implication.So they ARE in danger?So they **are** in danger?!this made my night I didn't like season 8 when it came out, but it has aged better than any other season.  Also, the gang gets analyzed is a top 10 episode> The first 5 seasons are all masterpieces.  Glad someone agrees with me. Too often I hear one Reddit that the seasons just keep getting better. 5 was their last masterpiece IMO. Seasons 6-8 had good episodes but the quality went down as characters Flanderized. Even some of the later seasons had good episodes like "Family Fight" and "The Jokes On Dee" but there are also a lot of episodes that are unwatchable for me.Sweet Dee Gets Audited is an amazing episode that I never see mentioned. Good call. I almost cried at the bit where Dennis blows chili powder in Dee's eyes.Rage all over from his head down to his shoesKYRIE 1 STAR. K-LOVE 1 STAR. JR 1 STAR!!!!

You aren't funny. You aren't hilarious in the slightest. I didn't laugh. I didn't grin, I didn't even exhale out of my nose. Your joke wasn't funny. Your joke was shit. It's stale and shitty. If you're going to make a joke, make an original one or at least improve the one you're taking. This was low effort. Step up your game, or just don't make jokes in the comment section at all.Ty Lou is rickety Cricket and Wade is Country Mac.

He speaks, they hear it and they ignore and make fun of him. Then they do their own thing.I think of Shump and JR as the McPoyle brothers.People say this every time but Mac literally says in the scene that all those people are realOn top of the Pepe thing, I always thought Carol in HR was actually "care of: HR". Unfortunately, one of the writers (I think Glenn Howerton) said it wasn't an illiteracy thing.  My theory is that the writers originally wanted it to be Charlie's illiteracy but decided it made no sense, since Pennsylvania would be shortened to PA on mail. Then they probably just kept Pepe Sylvia because it's a funny name. Either way, one of my favorite scenes.LET'S CALL DOOLEY!! DOOLEY LOVES TO PARTY!!!

I was kinda burnt out by then but I started crying laughing My wife is looking at me like she can't believe she married someone as dumb as me, but good godchurch did that crack me up. Perfect. The gang ruins him every day.D Rose is a street urchin I like Shump and JR as the McPoyles because of their Knicks brotherhood. Maybe my favorite [from the outtake reels.](https://youtu.be/TAl8q4dnIfk?t=223) Lmao look at Glenn's face.RIPthe bloopers to this are my favoriteYou only want to become a veterinarian so you can keep the skinThey will all pay the ultimate priiicccceeOne of my favorite scenes ever and if you haven't seen the outtakes of it you should definitely check it out.   In fact all of the Always Sunny bloopers are worth watching, I think they're my favorite of any show. It probably helps that Always Sunny is potentially my favorite show but here's the video of the outtake that I hopefully successfully timestamped: https://youtu.be/UB0F_Jah_R4?t=249That‚Äôs the most badasss thing about him. This is the best thread I have EVER READ on NBA Reddit. I'm literally dyingYea I have too much respect for him to call him Cricket lol. I like to go deep in /r/all while drinkingI believe I've made myself perfectly redundant.I AM NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IT WITH THE SKIN DEE I AM NOT ALLOWEDWell yeah, it is the most fascinating part of an animalI haven't seen that before, that was great! I couldn't handle working on the set of It's always Sunny, I'd die of laughing. Yeah I love their outtakes. My favorite is when, iirc, Charlie improvised the line where he pretended he didn't know they were criticizing him, and he's like "Yeah, he doesn't even, like, get us, man." and Glenn and Rob were cracking the fuck up because it was so unexpected. And Charlie just kept playing dumb perfectly.  Edit: [this one](https://youtu.be/BtqqeaKY2vY?t=1m52s)RIPI take it back ur greatYou havethat's because you're just a peasant only royalty can eat dragonsYou know I'm thinking we might need to get a 3 cat involved Lmao yes this is one of my favorites too! The reaction of Glenn in the first take when he realizes what Charlie said is fucking priceless
r/nba, [deleted]THIS AIN'T NBA JAM BABY Lebron just pulled off an All Star Game move in the NBA Finals.He's so athletic that halfway through of not knowing what to do with the ball he has enough time to then make the decision to toss it off the glass for a fucking dunkFirst thought was Lebron bby what is u doing   then OH. MY. GOD  IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELIMINATION GAME.  GOOD GODT-MAC APPROVESMJ never tossed an oop to himself in an elimination game in the NBA finals YOU CAN'T DO THAT LEBRON#WHAT THE FUCKMAMAHow do you have the balls to do that in an elimination game Did dis bron jus do disWhat the fuck did we just seeNUTThis was the most gangsta shit I have ever seenHOLY SHITDon't let this dunk distract you from the fact that Deron Williams scored more points than Chris Paul in the Finals.Get absolutely fuckedI used to hate on lebron..it's pretty hard to hate on him these days GAME OVER   NOTHING'S GONNA BE BETTER THAN THATFUCK THE NON-BELIEVERS CAVS IN 7This is how Westbrook is going to get all of his assists next season. Im proud to say i just came at the sight of a self alley oopNOOOOOOOOOOO   Edit: that's going near the top of the LeBron all-time plays highlight reel    Edit 2:  This thread is now the top post of all-time on r/NBA holy shitMy girlfriends father is in the hospital (not looking good) . I turned the.volume way down because people were crying, but I kept the TV on to distract myself. When I saw this happen, I jerked out of my seat and squeeked. I looked around and I realized I made a bad situation more awkward so I turned the TV off.That's what you think of when someone says man among boysThat's the nicest version of this play I have ever seen. Probably because it was Lebron's only option and not his first, second or third decision.This dude is just having fun.LeBron is an anomalyIt's such a liberating feeling to finally rooting for lebron.  When he dunked that ball it was like taking a giant spiritual shit.LeBron tryna dad dick the whole fucking planetNBA Street IRLLebron is a godWith no regard for Tristan Thompson's life!Holy shitTHE ALL STAR GAME WAS IN FEBRUARY!!!!Padding his stats. 2 points, 1 reb, 1 assist...http://i.imgur.com/UceHerj.gifOH MY GOD!!!!Lebron James is the greatest player of all time.Le dinners servedstop taking lebron for granted. we will never see another player like him. ITS RIGGED!!! THE REFS CHANGED THE GRAVITY SETTINGS!!!!Feast your eyes on the goat lady's and gentleman. If the Cavs somehow, someway find a win in game 5, Warriors fans are going to be shitting their pants.I'm not a basketball fan...I don't remember the last time I watched more than a quarter of a game...I couldn't tell you anything about anything when it comes to the sport. However, when I see highlights of Lebron doing shit like this I get mad at myself that I missed out on the opportunity to watch him in his career. That was absolutely amazing. I appreciate mastery of a craft and if that isn't someone who mastered what they do, I don't know what is. It's a shame what happened to his hairline though. Dad of the year dickIM AT FULL MAST BOISIf I'm Lebron, I bank my first gamebreaker, and save up for the level 2 game breaker instead.McGee was the only person on the Warriors bench to move an inch. He knew what the fuck he just saw.This is the closest T-Mac has been from an NBA Finals[deleted]Lebron full-on Daddicking the warriors rnNot a basketball guy, but judging by everyone's reaction that must be really hard to do? Dude made that look effortless.  [deleted]Hopefully he's not hurtLegendary shit Jesus Christ LebronI'm stunned. Dwill is better than cp3Dunked all over TTShoutout to the dude that tried to push his Kobe>Lebron agenda yesterday saying Kobe never got swept.No matter who wins, Lebron is the real MVP.Something about watching a game like this get rubbed into the faces of those cocky little bitches unfit to hold the King's towel is... just... so... SWEET!  There's a word for this, and we love it so dearly here on reddit.  You know what it is.We will be seeing this over, and over, and over again for the next 30 years or so.This is the top /r/nba post of all-time, and I'm not even sure this is the most impressive thing LeBron did this game.Love him or hate him, you're an idiot to deny his place among the ball gods. Man, that's some real shit.DUNKED ON HIS OWN TEAMMATE , HOLD MY BEER!!We have seen the greatest James one more time! So will next! Go James  I'm drunk anyone else?That's the coolest fucking thing that's ever happened. MOMMA, THERE GOES THAT MAN!My wife, "Do you talk to yourself when you watch the game on your own?"  Me, "When LeBron alley-oops himself; HELL YES I DO."This finals feels like it's LeBron vs. The Cavs vs. The WarriorsLearning to Lob yourself might be the greatest lob.... of all. It's like I'm watching Kagami, but this shit is real fucking life and not anime.Christ, this topped the boogie vs embiid ass slap fight.REFS DID THATThats some NBA Street type shit right thereThat's some NBA street shit right thereBill was right, this really is the allstar gameHe put TT on a poster lmaoooThank you so much OP, I was pissed they didn't show that replay immediately!one of the greatest single plays i have ever seen in all of my years watching NBA basketball.  They are still going to lose the series, but it was truly amazing. Rip Tristan ThompsonI watched this on a loop like 10 times and missed like a minute of game timeWow. Lebron James got himself a ally oop dunk against the Warriors defense in the NBA FinalsI don't remember the last time I jumped out of my seat like that while watching basketball.2 points, 1 rebound, 1 assistDid dis dude just do disThis is the kind of play I share to my friends to try to get them into basketball and NBA. Fucking glorious.My OG peeps from NBA Street know that's called Back to PapaBest assist of the night is......that technical foul to steve kerr hahaI'm drunk and on my porn account and fuck you if you don't think this man is the goatNot a basketball fan.. But why did #11 just let him go to the hoop? Actually why did the whole team just allow him to to walk right up? Is it just that rare of a move? I'm confused..This is the top post of all time on /r/NBA, it had to pass embiid and cousins slapping each other's assess to get here Saw this live in a bar with a bunch of Warriors fans around me, the entire bar screams OOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!   Everyone was amazed. LeTopPostAllTimeI was in a really shitty mood last night, flipped on the TV and saw this play and it immediately put me in a good mood. We are witnessing one of, if not, THE greatest basketball talent we have ever seenThe Refs Dunk the ball for him.Mamba mentality [deleted]Fuck, he has become self awareLeEvolving before our eyes. The real Kobe system.

Now this Fuck it, team on his back doe.His inner reptilian brain was saying "fuck it.Monster jam on them" from the key.Damn right.  LeBron is so ridiculously good.  It is such a pleasure to watch him play.  We should all enjoy his play while it lasts...because this isn't going to last much longer. We live bbyLebron is kill... wait no Lebron: Ssh is ok YoloUp by 20 though.  Would have been ridiculous if it was in a close game. I am cheering strongly against the Cavs and still shook my head and starting laughing in my living room. He is my sports arch-enemy, but I'd sell at least two toes to have him on my team.Ummm can I get 3 more games so I can witness the Finals Lebron and Elimination Game Kyrie even more?I ripped off my shirt when I saw this - it was completely involuntaryEveryone with eyes approves my manSo does Kobe[Hmm...](http://i.lvme.me/7tobtup.jpg)serious: was this always legal?Has MJ ever been in an elimination game in the finals?

He was looking for the pass to Tristan Thompson down low but he wasn't open as soon as LeBron decided to pass it so his only option was greatness.  Easy: take one ball, dribble it up the court, throw it off the backboard, and have no regard for human life.You have to not care that people will dieThey were up 19 in the third.

When he was on the heat, he was on the best team so he just seemed so cocky and on top of the world. But when he has to play against this team down in the series, he seems more humble and just shows you his power without showboating too much. Like the old lebron. Me too.. I feel like he had to earn his stripes.  And I was 12 and loved Kobe 2 deathDo you say this because fuck Kevin Durant? Cuz yes fuck KDHe's the Cristiano Ronaldo of Basketball.Other than, you know.. Back to back 3-1 comebacks baby! Ugh I'm upvoting a Celtics fan.If they coulda held onto Game 3 I would be all up on that hype train, but four in a row against this Ws team is nearly impossible.  That team is so fucking stacked it's not funny.   I'll take the Cavs top 3 in a 3 v 3 any day against ANY team from literally ANY era no bullshit.   But when you get down to 6-9 the Cavs bench is average at best, while the Warriors are rolling out All Star after All Star.   I think the depth will save the Ws this series. It'd be poetic as fuck to see Westbrook go to the Cavs and face the Warriors again with KD, that would some sports movie shit for the ages."Pass to himself"Lmao, imagine having to make a top 10 Lebron James highlight reel. He has more career defining highlights in his first two years alone, than most NBA players."Uh...go Gramps? No, wait. Don't go?

You might be reliving that moment randomly for the rest of your life. When you're 79, and laying in bed, your eyes'll snap open and you'll think, "Shit, that *was* awkward."Imagine if Bron had the power to raise her father from death and he just got up all hyped and doctors were like "damn he good now, you ready to be released tomorrow"/r/cringe material lol.Aw I was hoping your story was going to end with this dunk cured the guyalso because it was the FUCKING FINALSDon't think soThis is the first warriors fan comment I've seen in this thread lolLeNomaly The Stallion who Mounts the World GAMEBREAKER LVL.2That is MVP playing right thereHurry up with his damn croissantsLebron with the Kratos dunk.Posterized TTWhen you've run out of people to poster you have to start posterizing your own teammates.

Tune in.Honestly man Lebron hasn't slowed down since he came in as a high schooler. Granted his athleticism isn't about to drop off a bit due to age but his mind is there and only getting smarter. There's no bad time to pick up watching Lebron play. He's gonna be a guy you'll want to tell your grandkids about. Nobody like him is ever going to walk this earth againDude you're seeing it now. You just saw it tonight. You didn't miss it lol. You did not miss out. He has plenty of gas left in the tank and has stayed eerily healthy. He is more experienced and is probably playing more well-rounded basketball then he every has in his life.  Turn on Cavs games and watch him I prefer a safe Tim Duncan short range bank shot in NBA StreetWell not really (for them) but it's some ballsy showboaty shit in an elimination game in the finalsDefinitely the most memorable.

Just fucking looney tunes space jam nuts. Which toes are we talking? The ones that went to market? The ones that stayed home? There's a lot of variability in that commitment. Like, some of them had roast beef and others had no roast beef. That's gotta affect their trade value.Rip shirtAre you oprahsideversonBut also Tmac Klay and Durant disagreecan confirm have eyes do approve. And VinceWhat? Every other commercial I've seen during the Finals is that samsung journey shit with T-macI do it all the time in 2kYes. Jordan and Kobe did it few times. As long as the ball touches the rim, the board or another player, it's not traveling.   Edit : guys, the rule is very clear about it:  > A player who attempts a field goal may not be the first to touch the ball if it fails to touch the backboard, basket ring or another player.  From: Section XIV-Traveling  Also, MJ: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrwq1u6TPQQI will make it legal.it's a joke cause everytime Bron does something everyone always says "MJ woulda done it better" because he's the GOATOr maybe, someone made the mistake of telling him that. Back 2 Papa!Gonna be his best memory of this yrs finals. Let him have itI honestly started laughing The sports bar I'm in went instant barbarian.

Paul Pierce is Tons of people take LeBron for granted all the time. Everyone knows he's great, but I really don't think people appreciate just how great he is. This is going to sound outrageous, but the fact that he only has four MVPs, and none since 2013, is a pretty good indicator that he's being taken for granted. He is far and away the best player in the NBA, and is legitimately in the discussion for best of all time. Many people don't appreciate what that means.I wish.  Half my friends spend most of their time hating him purely because I'm at the age (30) where we were kids when Jordan was god.  Too many of my friends/family don't want to even admit Lebron is a top 5 player of all time.  This whole sub has been shitting on him these last 3 days lolI have so many friends and family who are casual friends and family who definitely are.  I don't think anyone that watches the NBA regularly possibly could though.I mean he missed some amazing shit, but yes better late than never. As a non-soccer fan, watching Ronaldo or Messi highlights give me similar regretful feelings.Honestly this is something that actually made me want to watch the next game. Atmosphere seems awesome at this game. Even though it's a joke it kinda makes sense. Like a shark and a lion are different animals and the same beast. Apex predators. Idk, Im drunk, can we get unidan in here?What the fuck does that mean hobojoe645?I miss him so much.Low key this is a great basketball nickname.WIDDA BROKEN LEGPick. A.

HOLY SHITI always try it in 2k but can never pull it off. Bron's out here doing shit *I can't even do in a video game.*Legal as a fox thenDid Jordan do it? No one did it in the NBA before Tmac and I swear I've seen every Jordan highlight I believe the name is Nerve Damage.

But, if you make it a habit, you'll begin to relish the little successes and progressions as you improve your skills!  Start today. Like, right now. Don't put your success off any longer!   Edit: Let's also keep in mind that LeBron is an anomaly. There's 9 other top-level athletes on the floor (literally, one in a million) that aren't even comparable to him. So, don't use that as your benchmark.case closed. I'd could like watching him more if he had a Suns jersey on.FUCK IT BANG MY DOGDoor is unlocked and I took 8 benadryl so I'd be asleep when u get herehe doooo/le/dddjddHe don't give a fuuuuuckNegative regard for human lifeLeBron confirmed going to turn to minor league soccer?yeah your dad is definitely downvoting you right now.

I mean it's entirely possible that he is just having fun considering they were up in the game at that point, but considering their team is down 0-3 in a best of 7 series (A team has never come back from a 3-0 deficit in NBA history) he's probably actually not having fun. He's also been their best player these playoffs by a pretty wide margin.  MVOATMVP in sports almost never actually means what the acronym stands forGood point. Let's all upvote this comment.Paul Pierce hates him haha>"MJ is the king.  Lebron has to pass the rooks and the pawns before he can be compared to the king."  Really, guys? This exactly. Voter fatigue is real. He was robbed twice. I'd say that's more a reflection of how the MVP is determined, while LeBron has been the best player he hasn't always had the best regular season.Last 3 days? The sub has been slandering him since they lost game 1. I swear to God Messi in 2011/12 is the greatest single season performance from an athlete I've ever seen.Just change your attitude! Go out and watch em, or even watch the highlights and enjoy them instead of feeling like you are missing out! No, you are a Celtics fan. You cannot possibly understand.Didn't unidan get banned a few years back?Here's the thing...[deleted]Ok, I don't watch basketball very much, so I figured this "pass to self off of backboard" had happened at least a few times, but probably never in a playoff game.  The fact that Kobe has a damn highlight reel of doing that blows my mind. He's doing that against a good portion of the best players in the world like it's fucking street ball or a video game. That's some shit I'd pull against my little brother in a 1v1 for a final shot if I'm up by 5.OH SHIT ITS **DARREN SHARPAA** ONE OF THE HARDEST HITTING SAFETYS IN THE LEAGUELets go inside the mind of a **Greg Jennings**   # DrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrdYeah LeBron is a high steppaOh no, here come Great Value J. ColeYou're my favorite. Amen. It takes 2 minutes for those motherfuckers to close a lead like 20. Its more like being up by 6 or 7 pointsStill not better than MJNah, fuck whatever coding they have for off the backboard oops. That shit is cheese. You have to be wide open for it to work. If you get a steal at half court and then fast break to the rim it's my go to move.   PS4: double tap triangle, hold square.  Xbox: double tap Y, hold X.

No bullshit. I work at 10 AM tomorrow    Edit: I have to wait until 4, when my GM comes in, but my managers are game open and shut case johnsonLet's say LeBron announces tomorrow he goes to the Suns. How do you react?"i wanna fuck a dog in the ass"  -Tom delogneY'all some nephews/nieces frI too am LeBron on this blessed day 3-0 memes. FUCK KDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kolNcY53sHe could retire after that play right then, and nobody would question his legacy. Go out with a bang.Block on splitter was the nastiest block outside of the finals last year.  I'd put that in his top 5.  [The Block on Splitter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI8-PbK1wmY)With KD guarding him.A team also never returned from a 3-1 deficiency in the finals less than a year ago üòàüòàüòàNo team had ever come back from a 1-3 deficit in the finals until last year.yessirDid he actually say that?It's just a reflection on what Lebron prioritizes. He is by far and away the best player and there's no doubt about that. If he chose to focus on getting the MVP or defensive player of the player he could probably get it on any given year, but he's aiming for longetivity and not being worn down in the playoffs.Fair point.he did. it was a farcical meta reference. After watching the video it seems like most of the time he did it when he was double teamed. Once he released, he would split the double and rebound for the layup. I miss him so much :/THEY CAN'T STOP MEDARREN SHARPAA SERVIN UP THE HARDEST HITTING COCKTAILS IN THE LEAGUEDARREN SHARPAA HOLD MA DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKThat how meme has a new meaning after he got sentenced for [18 years](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17337413/ex-nfl-star-darren-sharper-gets-18-years-drugging-raping-women)A Cleveland city reppa oh my babyI'm my favorite. With LeBron on the bench it only takes 32.8 seconds  Edit: grammarIt's so insane to watch. When the Nuggets are down 20 it feels like they'll do everything they can, hit some shots and they cut it down to like 14 by the end of the game if they're lucky.  With the Warriors, they're down by 20, then you fucking blink and suddenly they're right back in it.It's more like being down by 20.MJ would've come back from a 1,680 point deficit against this year AND last year's warriors at the same timeMJ would never have met the deficit reach 1679, and he'd have easily come back from 1678 downBut I like cheese.And lavar ballYou're right. I believe it's actually Dinner's Served.The move you are looking for is dinner served. Once Lebron threw the ball of the backboard he had "served it up" and once he completed the dunk "dinner had been served"Nonsense, he's suggesting a team can blow a 3-0 lead!LeBron is kill If you work in Portland I'm coming to your restaurant. RemindMe! in 1 daydo it for the culture famWe're all Lebron. Just make a lineLmao, how insane is it that Mo Williams was an all star that year. How do you mess up a pass that bad, to a guy who can jump that high lolThat's not human.his chin was above the rim what the absolute fuckThis is insaneCan you posterize someone on a block? [Cause I'm pretty sure that's what happened.](http://i.imgur.com/77IAlzk.jpg)He's gotta one up himself every year next year he will have to be down 3-1 in the conference finals.BANGYes that's when I knew Paul pierce tucks his dick backwards when watching these games. Just like in an interview I think it was the first time KD won the scoring title, Lebron said he could've won the scoring title that year or every year if he wanted to, but he cares more about winning and getting the ring.  Going back reading the comments from when he said that is funny. One guy replied "he can talk the talk..."Nah. Different animal; same beast....I know some of these words...FUCK YOU GUMBYTOUCHDOOOOOOOWNNNNNNNNNNOhh noo he stole the ball!! What is yu doing bby?I love it when you do watcha do, babyWith Kawhi off... well you know lol.I don't know, man. That doesn't seem accurate. We need a mathematician to break these numbers down for us. I don't know man, let me check  20=20  Yeah the math checks out, you're right bro.Serving it up...  Dinner's served!Time to play Street Vol. 2 again.Let's consult bobbito garciaapology for poor english  where were you when lebron james dies?  i was sat eat jam on couch when phone ring  "lebron is kill"  "no" LeKill is BronSwing through to Nashville and I got you man! Mediocre service but my table side manner makes up for it Mo was pretty good that year tbf. Terrible pass though.Yeah I guess if he's 6'8" (80 in) and the rim is 10' (120 in), then he had to jump 42"+ to get his head that high above the rim.Like right. If there's a reason to keep the goat status away from Lebron, it's because we haven't yet proven he's human. Shit 14 years in, but would you really be surprised if he pulled this shit next game?Down 3-1 in the finals and someone from the Cavs get shot on the court and they keep playing over the body. Lol no idea why I phrased this the way I didLet's go into the mind of a Greg Jennings HOLD MY DIIIIIIICKCROSSS THE PLAAAAAANESo much DETERMINATION tho49-20 man. Fuck. Wit. Me.It took a quarter and a half. That's a win in my book.About Tree Fiddy.Any score against the warriors you just add on 0.25 points for every minute remaining in the game.  This play was made nominally up by 19, but with 21 minutes remaining, so it was actually up by about 14.You rang?  The Cavs were up about 20.  There were about 20 minutes left in the game.  Left to their own devices, the Warriors can be expected to make up about 2 points of a lead per minute.  Ergo, you're actually down 20 and making plays to make up the deficit.  Sanity check: The Dubs had 75 points here.  21 minutes later, they had 116 points, which is 41 more points, which is about 2 points per minute.  Math checks out.Right in the nostalgiaFrom Downtowwwwn!!I've heard the Cleveland school system was bad. Now I can see what they mean Playing with Lebron. Even a bad pass there is an assist for Williams. I'm sure Lebron covered up a lot of flaws. And while that up high in the air, he had to have the coordination to catch a basketball that was flying past him about 5 feet away, horizontally, from where it should be.  The other day, I was playing 3v3 Ranked Rocket League. Two minutes into the game, we were down 2-1 when one of my teammates quit.    The mate that didn't‚Äã quit and I ended up taking the game to OT and winning 3-2, despite playing 2v3 for almost 7 minutes.    The point being, if I can do it then LeBron can too. BbbrrrtttrrpppThat's an entire series victory in my book.Fucking goddamnit Spurs would've taken at least 2 games imo. Zaza took that from the fans.TAKE THAT FOR DATA!People don't think it be like it is, but it doThis is true; when he jumped his back was to the Blazers' bench and when he landed, he was facing them.   Complete 180 just by mid-air adjustments.MUH LEG BROKE... I DONT KNO HOW THE FUCK IM RUNNIN RIGHT NOW..... GOTTA DO THIS SHIT.... FAH MADDEN

I loved it.At 9:11 pm, PST, Wesley Johnson's wikipedia page was locked. Between 8:16 and 9:11 pm, Wikipedia contributors battled back and forth, adding and removing various causes of the retirement and/or death of Wesley Johnson. A total of 280 edits were registered in those 55 glorious minutes. Here is a abridged timeline of the events:    The original shit-post, posted at 8:16 PST: Johnson's career ended early when James Harden broke his ankles, stared him down, and shot a 3-pointer on February 28th, 2018.    One minute later another user added this subtle piece in Johnson's Clippers section: On February 28th 2018 his career was killed by a James Harden cross over.    7 minutes later, another user adds to his personal info: Father: James Harden.    For the next 15 minutes, several edits lead us to this:    Johnson died on February 28, 2018 after James Harden cooked him and put him in a bodybag. He could not be rushed to a nearby hospital as his ankles were glued to the ground. Wesley's funeral will be held in the secret tunnel that Chris Paul used to get to the locker room. His mother later disowned him posthumously.    Then the mods caught on, and over 250 edits took place back and forth, shit-posts and revisions being posted at astonishing rates. Between 8:47 and 8:52 alone, 53 edits were posted, averaging 1 edit every 5.6 seconds. Here are some of the best:    On February 28, 2018, Houston Rockets SG James Harden murdered Wesley's ankles on national television. James proceeded to stare into Johnson's soul before draining a 3 & ending his life. He's expected to announce his retirement after the game.    His career came to a close after James Harden viciously snatched his ankles mid game on Febuaray 28th, 2018.    On February 28, 2017, Wesley got dropped my James Harden, who cooked him up. This subsequently ended Johnson‚Äôs career.    On February 28, 2018 Johnson tragically broke both of his ankles in one of the meanest moves of this generation.    On February 28, 2018 Johnson had his ankles shattered by the bearded monster Harden. His basketball career also ended that day, as he announced his retirement immediately afterwards.    Death: On February 28, 2018, Wesley was brutally murdered by James Harden. An LAPD investigation determined that Wesley died from blood loss after breaking his ankles. His family changed their last names out of shame. Hopefully, he finds the secret tunnel into the afterlife.    And then he got rekt by the Beard with tears in his eyes as the ball splashed all over him.    On February 28th he had a career ending ankle injury resulting in the amputation of his legs due to a James Harden crossover.    On February 28, Johnson's career was forced to end abruptly after James Harden viciously broke his ankles, stared at him for 3 whole seconds, then proceeded to drain a 3 in his face. Wesley Johnson post game said " I can't do this anymore. James Harden is my father, I don't see the point in playing this game anymore." He proceeded to cry and take his bags to James Harden's house where he will live there for 12 more years.    His career was ended by his daddy James Harden by the most deadliest crossover in NBA history.    On February 28, 2018, Johnson became the first NBA player to die on-court, when James Harden took his ankles, and his life.    On February 28, 2018, Johnson lost his ankles, dignity, and pride from being sauced by James Harden.    On February 28, 2018, Johnson had to retire after getting crossed over badly by James Harden. He was carried off the court in a stretcher never to play basketball again. Harden was given the MVP trophy immediately following the game.Jesus christThat was BRUTALOh no...r/watchpeopledie Damn he better hit the shot after staring that longSo boring to watchAbsolutely Disgusting. That was the MVP play right there.  Why even have a discussion now?Fucking MVBFwhatever beef there was between rockets and clippers was ended there.holy shit that will be on highlight reels for the rest of time.. dirtiest play ive ever seenIs Wesley smiling as he's jogging down the court? If so, he handled that really well.In all the alternate angle videos the push off is so damn minimal and it‚Äôs a step back with no walk. Dirtiest play of the fucking season. Thoughts and prayers to the Johnson family Look up disrespect in the dictionary and you‚Äôll see this Okay that was straight up nasty but in almost 11 minutes of the 1st quarter, the Clippers have only scored a total of 7 pts???   That was so disrespectful the ESPN crew had to pause their conversation to commentate the game.Unbelievably disrespectful and baller as fuck.  In a season where he‚Äôs the obvious MVP that people are hesitant to crown for whatever reason, this is the kind of play that stands out.RuthlessSaw it live, absolutely filthy the wiki for Wes üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠SHEESH #SENT HIM TO THE GOD DAMN SHADOW REALMJames Harden is the only man to stay at the top of his game after dating a Kardashian.GOAT BEHAVIOURAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THAT WAS SO DISRESPECTFUL Am I the only one who thought it was a pushoff?[Harden looking at him like](http://queenofreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Shrek_Still_KS_003-e1466428065705.jpg) Probably one of the dirtiest moments in recent basketball history...feel filthy watching this man.

Fortunately, the guy a few seats over was also watching and texted me to freak out with me.He paused for so long I thought my browser had frozen...Those sneakers tonight have already been called "the staredown"  on Solecollector. Damn.Wish kemba would have hit that shot last night.This is Harden's career highlight imoLol Ricky Rubio is so happy this happened. His fall is no longer the worst on Hardens highlights.And Wesley Johnson's tooTaunting, automatic first downThis was so disrespectful that it almost feels like it warrants a TI gave myself a T just for watching that shit.Ariza should've gotten a T for running off the bench and down the sideline after the shot but the refs let him slide cuz of how filthy that crossover wasdefinitely would've been beaned in baseball"Should we have called a tech on Harden there?"

This shit is literally a top 3 most disrespectful play ever to happen on an nba court. My goodness. he waited so long to shoot that i thought it was called an offensive foulHe even let him get up. That was awesome [deleted]the score on this makes this even dirtierYou know it's bad when a dude can take a solid 4 seconds before shootingLegit thought the play was stopped. Disgusting.It was brutal. I thought the play was called dead the way everyone just stood around. Harden is filthy. I wonder if these two teams have any history.My goodness that shit was nasty. Harden is a god.Lol peep [D'antoni](https://i.imgur.com/HkokEfQ.png) in the background, just business as usualIt's even better in context.

This was straight fucking filthy.James Harden also put up more points in the 1st quarter than the entire Clippers team scored.  James Harden: 17 points in 1st quarter  LA Clippers: 12 total point in 1st quarter Somebody needs to make a thug life video out of this.I'm gonna have to get myself ejected if that happened to me in front of so many people lol. I'd have to start a fight or something.I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills Waited for him to get back up and everything üòÇJust nasty man that's all I said when I saw it. I would fucking love for harden to somehow squeeze a championship in while everyone is talking about GSW and LeBron. Harden just disrespected this man's entire bloodlineErr he waited for him to get up and waited for another man to contest his shot   yup he just told the clippers ur defenders are trashseriously....I mean - what is he supposed to do now? is he expected to keep playing? retire?  I think he should probably retireReminds me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJMsoIptQoThe only possible way he could have been more dirty and disrespectful is if he never broke eye contact while draining the three. I guess you have to save something for the second quarter though. God damn. Right now we‚Äôre about 14 minutes in and you can already tell this is about to be the top post all time on this subreddit It was 31-7 lolThe LA Slippers LOFL üòÇüòÇüòÇYo I'm dying. Thank you for the screenshot.Ask Wes to pick it up for youlmaoAt least mark it NSFL NEPHEWThis is how Johson's going to be remembered now[close up of Johnson](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AntiqueFreeBittern-max-1mb.gif)DELETE THAT FOOTAGE![deleted]this is going to last forever my friendHarden is the patriarch of that family now.that family had a wes johnsonI‚Äôm at the game, all wes Johnson could do was smile That had to be the most savage play of the decade, holy shit.Regardless of what team you cheer for, you still have to appreciate this play. Was at the game tonight.  There was a lot of rockets fans there.  harden's from LA, comptonThat one guy that turned away in horror as the shot went in. Texas has no state income tax, so it checks outhttp://i.imgur.com/d8PIhSP.jpghttps://imgur.com/iahCcOU**^^Phw^oo**SheeshHe's not lying though. They couldn't do anything about himUhhhh-wooh*dials microwave*Because James Harden sure as shit doesn't.That why it's so spicy, you gotta have the balls.YOU ARE IMAGINING A NON-PROBLEM.you cant miss after breaking someones ankles We wouldn‚Äôt have this precious moment I guess we‚Äôll never know So is WesHe STARED at him, let him get up and fucking SWISHED it. I'm fucking done, this was too amazing hahahaPutting someone on the floor increases the probability of your shot going in by 50%. I'm here as well /r/allThis is going to be the most upvoted thread in r/NBA historySomeone call someone lmaoWow that was dissapointing. Lol that was pretty lameCLEAN UP ON AISLE 3SOMEONE CALL SOMEONEHonestly thought that would‚Äôve been better. Maybe they were in shock. The "cleanup on aisle 3" kinda killed it for me. If he had just shouted "SOMEONE CALL SOMEONE", it would've been legendaryChrist. The rockets need new announcers that was stupid.As a Harden lover, I'm done for the nightMan it must be hard to be a Harden hater when he makes dudes look that foolishhttp://i.imgur.com/SORGN8x.gif.mp3with the cocoIt's up there with when Iverson stepped over Lue imoAKA James Harden.These plays never happen at home it‚Äôs so annoying Not at all.  Harden was just checking on Wesley to see if he needed medical attention.  He didn't think it was necessary because Wesley's ankles were dead.  Then he just drained the 3 in memory of Wesley's ankles.I have enjoyed that.My 3 time mvp tbh @/u/TrooperRamRod I agreeYeah we'll be seeing this on all kind of top 10s on YouTube for years to come.Easily one of my favorite Harden plays of all time Lmao somebody needs to edit the r/nba logo onto Johnson Don't be fooled this was just a long free throw literally unwatchable. The handles are ruining the game. THIS ISNT HOW BASKETBALL WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYEDNBA NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE HIM Well, the score was 31-7 at this point, soooo...  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to watch this clip another hundred times.SHEEEESHNearly every "ankle breaker" that makes this sub is a blatant push off, or someone tripping on a shoe etc... Even got the "Los Angeles Slippers" in there.  [muah] perfecto!Or his lifespan to July 11, 1987-February 28, 2018That's so nice that your watching our family videos again son! As a teacher, I say fuck you both. More like soul collectorKemba will still always have the Pitt ankle breaker to win the game, so I think he‚Äôs good.Yea that was nice but this is still way dirtier. *Throws flag off the court*Ball placed at the spot of the foul.Touchdown Seahawks Yellow card issued as a warningThe change in posture as he stares him down is small but carries so much weight. Harden actually got out of shooting stance to marvel at his work. Unreal lmfaoTake away a draft pick from the Rockets for doing this.  Take away another draft pick from the Clippers for letting this happen.Remember when James got a T for staring down the Jet after he dunked on him? "Hold my Cosmo" -Lauren HoltkampMotherfuckers too quick these days This is gold LOLDamn this is what happens when someone's career ends. Wesley... Pack up your shit and move to a island with no internet. Harden will attend the funeral. Stare down Johnson's entire familyClosed casket? They're gonna cover his ankles?When I saw the headline, I was like "Meh. I'm sure it's hyperbole." And then I was like "JHFC, this should be tagged NSFW and crossposted to /r/watchpeopledie  I hate Harden because GSW, but holy shit... such a dick move. LMAO. Honestly, the way the refs have called games the season I'm surprised it wasn't a tech.Harden's a bully tbhHe was watching his victim bleed out, before finishing him off with a mercy shot.We need More angles! I wanna see their eyes!Ice fucking cold. This play gonna be legendaryNo. He didn't. Johnson was dejected. He sat on the floor much longer than he should have. Even the look on his face sums it up: he just wants to go home. He gets up and just walks away, as if hoping no one saw, before snapping back to reality , hurrying to get this thing over with.I think Harden TOLD him to get up.hahahaha man this is so funny to imagine.  That stare lasted longer than I do in bed.now they do17 for Harden, 12 for the Clips in the 1st quarter.  wtfHarden in the 1st quarter: 17 points   Clippers team in the 1st quarter: 12I'd literally rather someone slap me across the face with their dick than do this to me. not that i want someone to slap me across the face with their dickYou know what makes it better? The four players on the floor were just watching him with the stoicism. They were probably internally shocked or somethingThis shit is r/peoplefuckingdying materialWay more honestly. Iverson the play was over.   Harden just intentionally made the shot harder to mock Wesley and then just nailed it anyway. Randolph Childress' wasn't shabby either  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJMsoIptQoThis is literally what I just did. I thought they called a push off. Then I realized what was happening.You shop a harden beard on him and that's worth gold./u/sim888 you got competiton boy!And now this https://mobile.twitter.com/aaron_denman/status/969066864310673408/photo/1Those wiki edits lmaohttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXLS3kaWkAAFyMu?format=jpg&name=orig jesus i found this pic from the commentsI was sat at home drinking rokeet fuuels when Doc ring, 'Johnson is kill'  'no'  and you????I still like [Shaq's dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqEpo3ev1j0) as maybe he most disrespectful moment of all time.they played The Next Episode right after it in the stadium, basically did it for us irlI'd go the opposite way with it and lay face down on the floor until the arena empties out.That would be even more embarrassing imo. That‚Äôs a low blow. Ur a savage/u/screwst0n if you real mark it as NSFWThink about his family man. They're gonna have to watch him get slaughtered in 1080pPoor guy had a career[Look at me, I'm the father now. ](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-rVZEejvVWEbug)Yeah you could see in the replay that he was smiling. He knew he just had his ass eaten alive, and he kinda liked it.dude why are there so many fans cheering for harden over thereI've played in pick up games where the Johnson player would give a real dirty foul, and the whole incident escalates into a fight.  The level of disrespect Johnson took is off the chartsr/watchpeopledieinside This or Lebron spinning the ball in Ibaka's face before hitting the 3 in last year's playoffs You pay income taxes on road games, though, if I remember correctly.I meeeean phwOOThis right here is a big dick maneuver. If you fuck this up after that staredown it is one of the greatest failures in years. But he did not fail.HOW MUCH WOOD COULD A WOODCHUCK CHUCK -Kemba WalkerIt‚Äôs just not possible I wish someone did a study of this, I swear to god guys like CP3/Harde/Curry/Kyrie shoot like 90% after dropping someone.Honestly he played it off well. All he could do is fuckin smile lmao.This title doesn‚Äôt do the play justice. We‚Äôd already be on the front page if it said ‚ÄúJames Harden banishes Wesley Johnson‚Äôs ankles to the Shadow Realm!!!‚ÄùI was the first comment but I wasn‚Äôt witty enough...  I‚Äôm buried behind my more comical peers  All the karma that could have been will keep me up at night periodically for the rest of my life....I NEED AN ADULT!If ‚Äúsomeone call someone‚Äù doesn‚Äôt became a r/nba meme of half-assed commentary, I‚Äôll be sorely disappointed.

We should've kept this guyI now have death grip All it takes is him drawing a reaching foul or allowing a defender to get around him and the hate train will be leaving the station. .wmvyes boyI fuckin look forward to it. Absolutely terrific momentOr a slippery floor, very rarely do we see legit ankle breaker in the NBA. found u/verifiedsonFair enough. Due to the nature of my program, my professors are okay with it, but I completely understand why you wouldn‚Äôt be. I have a lot of respect for teachers, thanks for what you do.

Harden got out of his shooting stand to hack Johnson‚Äôs bank account, legally claim his children and then file his taxes before getting back in the stance to drain a 3 on him.  I‚Äôm getting a vibe of the ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù simpsons memeIt also seems like the Clippers players were in awe of the play. They let Harden stare Johnson down for 3 seconds before they remembered they were still playing.Yeah, he relaxed, looks at him and then casually drains the 3  Before watching it I was wondering why this had 25k upvotes. After seeing it I gotta say it deserves every single one of those. Still the greatest posterization in history.Los Angeles Slippers üòÇüòÇHarden will deliver the eulogy  "He was my nephew."lmao that shit was 100x more offensive than some techs that have been called this season. This cheeky son of a bitch really found a way to stare someone down when the refs can't call a tech oh my godI mean, it's debatable if waiting to take a shot while the play is live can be a tech.  If he drilled the shot, stood there staring at Wes, they probably call that, but how do you criticize someone waiting for a shot when the play is live?No. Hell no. He was teaching Johnson. What is he thinking, reaching in, trying to steal the ball? Has he no idea who this man is? No my guy, Johnson needed to learn this. And he needed to be made an example of , for all that follow who think they can reach for the ball when it's in his Highness' hands.The MVP trophy is going to be changed to Harden‚Äôs stare-down stance.It's his MVP moment. Westbrook had the game winner last year, Harden has thisCan you imagine if he missed it lmao the half of the sub that hates Harden would have a field dayThe Houston Hardensyou honestly have to watch the last couple plays before this. He was going offDoc Rivers might reopen the tunnels!And it would have been 9 if the refs called that backcourt!That's pretty weird.Agreed. He needed to be benched in shame after that move. Is that not what happened It took a full three second for everyone on the floor to even process it and start moving again. It was 31-7. They already gave up.I love the fan behind the bench jumping out of his seat and turning around to see if anyone else will be brought in as witnesses for the murder.  /r/watchpeopledieinsideTrue. Also Lue tripped over himself and Iverson took advantage of it. Harden just mucked Wes and wanted to make sure he felt like shit for it.Nah, stepping over a player is way more disrespectful. Especially in the Finals. Beating a team that went 11-0 through the Western Conference Playoffs.Shoes squeaked so loud they sounded like a whistle.https://i.imgur.com/unUqnRu.pngWorth the ban.

I completely understand going to the game, supporting your friend and former teammate, but god damn, stay the fuck out of the shot.This face seems fitting for Magic this season.

Seems like a lifetime ago that those three played together. And they were in the friggin' Finals. That run was really just '10 to '12 (fun but tough series vs. LAL in '10, another fun but tough battle with DAL in '11, then another fun and tough Finals vs MIA in '12).  Damn they got knocked out by the champs every season during that run.That feeling when you draft 3 mvps and win 0 titles.You expect the average nephew in 20 years to even know these people. They'll know Bron and Steph and that's it.Got into the NBA a few years ago and somebody post a picture of those three in OKC uniforms with the title "Imagine if these guys played together" and I totally fell for it. Pretty incredible how great they could be all if they were together right now.DAE else think that KD was a quitter for leaving OKC?r/whooooshIm curious to see how long the word "meme" survives and what will someday replace itJordan wou'shouldn't'sve'ne'erSKIEEEUUUPStairIf I was that rich I would just always pay for an extra night so I could sleep inHoly God I haven't seen this is so long. I remember seeing it and thinking about how old LeBron would be when 2016 rolled around. And now it's 2019 and he's still fucking the league. Edit: spellingFucking hell lolI've never seen this and am dying on the train and people trying not to look at me.ome is so fucking goodAbsolutely.  I wish he didn't come back to fight Ngannou.  I knew what was going to happen.  He should have stayed on his couch, he could make a lot of money being an analyst/calling fights.There's a whole fucking industry built on complaining about whatever LeBron does. You're doing yourself a disservice paying attention to it.That shit basically turned him into a villain when he was dancing with Danny Green or whoever that was all the time with the CavsDunk was so nasty the Rockets bench still kinda celebrated tho!Is that near leboston?Lemphis? ^plsM'lantaWhat? LeTlanta Hawks?You fucker don‚Äôt make me laugh. I don‚Äôt know you!If you pass LeBouisville you've gone too farOr, in my case, the worst.Some relationships are worth revisiting and some aren‚Äôt. You have to evaluate the issues that led to the breakup in the first place and if you have both grown to a point where those issues won‚Äôt come up again or can be handled better. Not saying it isn‚Äôt worth it, but remember that you are still the same people.  Source: have gotten back together with my big ex like 3 times.Jack off bro, it'll clear your mind and you'll see that it's a bad ideaBut are you interested in her or just interested in the idea of having someone again?There was a meme floating around Reddit last year that read:   "Getting back together with an ex is like reading your favorite book and expecting a different ending."  What broke you up last time will likely be what breaks you up again.  Proceed with caution, homie.You better have a nice couple of drinks before you make that decision.Fucking hell, every time I think that r/nba can't think of any better comparison than what I've already seen, I'm always proven wrongCongratulations on making me shit myselfDefinitely a stretch but I'm into itIt's really a terrible look.  His chin and jawline are aready large and we'll defined, adding more depth makes it look cartoonish.  His crew is probably too afraid to tell him he looks like and Amish fuckstick.Yea he should just shave his head bald and grow a stacheStache Bron made him an 80s legend.Yeah it's got a classic look to it. If it was in black and white people would appreciate it a lot more.Holy fuck. Is this what looking at the 80s is like? God damn. He looks sexy, but I've never said that about a man with a stache like that before.   &#x200B;  This is new.Those beards do not look good on anyone.Agreed, that's honestly his best look.he looks like a badass like that, like Dr J or somethingHe looks Indian in this picBest LeBron meme format by farDamn the stache looks smooth on him. Kinda makes me think of Idris Elba for some reason.Looks like Lavar Ball."I am aware of the effect I have on ~~women~~ the Raptors"well doneSince Wolverine, I just call Hugh Huge Jacked Man.Movie magic baybee.If I've learned anything, it's that Hollywood doesn't care about source material.  Even movies based on real events.And Hugh Jackman is 6'2"I liked Jackman as Wolverine, but I've always disagreed with people who think he's irreplaceable in the role and this is a huge reason why. Logan is supposed to be a short stocky looking sorta dude with very rough and rugged facial features, not some tall, lean and handsome guy with a pretty face. Guys like Russell Crowe and Mel Gibson (coincidentally both also Australian) are closer to his comic book look IMO. Jackman did grow on me over the years though because I think as he aged into the role, he started to get more of that mean and rugged look on his face that Logan is supposed to have.I think that trend of losing to the eventual champs continued for a couple years past that tooI never really put it together that Harden was on the OKC team that went to the Finals. How was he back then? Didn't really follow the league at that point.It could be worse. Your team could draft future MVP's in 2 straight seasons and then leave your city immediately after.Nephews know Reggie and Ewing and Drexler. They'll know Russ and Kawhi and Dwight.I disagree to some extent. KD's run with the Warriors and his multiple MVPs will be a big deal.  Harden might have trouble being commonly remembered if he doesn't get a ring, but his scoring dominance and MVP are working in his favor.  Westrbook averaging a triple double for 3+ seasons and his record with the most triple doubles will constantly be brought up.   Plus with social media, players have much bigger brands and followings. I think all 3 of them will still be household names in 20 years, or at least among r/NBA nephewsNah they'll prolly know KD tooThat‚Äôs like saying this generation doesn‚Äôt know who Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, and Dominique Wilkins are.You're crazy if you think Steph will be remembered in 20 years and KD won't.Man, why does nobody in that subreddit get any of those jokes?Meme is going to end up replacing the word "thought" or something stupid like that.wou'shouldn't'sve'ne'er looks like the name of small welsh village in the countrysideIt's spelled Worchestershire sauce.Stairwowww same we're 3 years past what was supposed to be the future lmao. i keep saying 2019 is way too deep in the future. we should have stopped existence like 2015 this is too muchScores a lot: statpads, doesn't let young players develop  Scores less than 20: doesn't take over games, washed up  Displays emotion: how fucking dare you be so goofy/angry  Doesn't display emotion: how fucking dare you be so disconnected  Rests/heals a lot: it shouldn't take that long, go play through the injury despite any risk  Rests/heals a little: the fuck are you doing, you will ruin your body, how will media make money off you  Leaving the bench is a crime against United States of America.Certainly not LeAMy aunt had that. She dead now.What is wrong with you?At least you know your next (Zion) has potential to be way better than your ex (Porzingas)Big girls need love too. Do you, bro.Man this is some good advice. Relationships aren't just dead because you broke up, it depends on what caused the break up. Sometimes the underlying problems can mean that it will never work, but sometimes just being in a different place in life is what was needed.Who is broNot necessarily,  jack off and if you still wanna do it, then do itKenjataimu manOr maybe don'tthrow in a hoop earing and he's literally become JordanHe already wears the number 23. People will REALLY starting comparing him then.Call him LeMailman[it does have a classic look to it now that you mention it](https://i.imgur.com/rrEWAOO.jpg)> Holy fuck. Is this what looking at the 80s is like?   Yep! This was the look in the 80's. He' s missing eyeglasses that cover half his face, but yep that was the 80's.You'd be surprised how many Indian people could pass off as Mexican or black based off physical appearance.LeBron Jainan indian relative of mine looks super similar to bron. this is the first picture where ive seen it go the other way thoBruh the durag makes him look like an Indian construction worker.The whole Eastern Conference"There‚Äôs games beyond the fucking game." LeBron "Stringer Bell" JamesThat would be hilarious to see him shrunk like the hobbits in LOTR next to normal size actorsClint Eastwood tried to make a movie that's true to life, so much so that he didn't get actors to play the protagonists but the actual people involved in the event.  No surprise; the performances were not great.I believe the Heat beat the Spurs in the 2013 finals so it was just 2010 to 2012 that they lost to the eventual champs.6moty candidate type of player, but played like shit in the finalsCould be the lions and draft two of the greatest offensive weapons of all time and them both retiring early because the teams couldnt winNah. Y'all got a ring out of it at least. the Thunder don't even have that going for them.I always wonder how I‚Äôm gonna explain guys like Iguodala and Shane Battier and Hedo Turkoglu to my sonDon't forget all the *infamy* behind Harden too. Like him or not, the fact that he's one of the all-time most notorious floppers will keep his legacy relevant for decades.Out of the 3 as it stands I feel like Westbrook might be the one most easily forgotten. Triple doubles have largely lost their allure the last few years to the point that it‚Äôs really not a big deal any more. Delon Wright closed the year with 3 triple doubles in 4 games and no one really cared. Just a few years ago people were so amazed at Westbrook averaging a triple double they couldn‚Äôt help but give him a MVP even though he was a 6 seed, this year he‚Äôs not even considered the best player on his own team despite maintaining the averages for the 3rd straight year. I imagine we‚Äôll just be getting more and more desensitized to triple doubles over time as it‚Äôs so common these days.  On top of that his lack of post-season success so far and playing on a small market team doesn‚Äôt exactly help, so unless that changes I‚Äôm not confident in calling him as memorable as KD or HardenI memet(?) so> small welsh village in the countryside  bro is there even any other kind of Welsh settlementStair2015 was when we got DS2 so it wouldn't have been a bad time to stop tbhDoubt it's in the vicinity of Lewaukee[deleted]R.I.P to your auntI‚Äôm pretty good right now but I appreciate the offer friend.

r/nba, There‚Äôs absolutely no excuse for a professional basketball player in the biggest game of the season to not know the score. WTF JR just guaranteed Lebron isn't coming back*I was gonna make the game winning lay up but then I got high*Shaqtin' a fool Champion 2018how do i change my usernamejr won the dumbass-off with nick youngHe literally says to lebron ‚ÄúI thought we were up‚ÄùLebron: Wtf was that bro?!  JR: Bruh ... I thought we was up....  George Hill: *thank god JR fucked this shit up*I think my favorite part is that JR thought he had just made a heroic rebound to ice the game He didn‚Äôt know the score, Classic JRHow can you be situationally so unaware, especially as someone who has been to the finals that many times. JR never ceases to amaze us in the most wrong way possible First time basketball watcher here with a quick question trying to understand the sport better.  Is it better to get the rebound while it's tied with a few seconds left and score to win it in regulation or is it better to grab the rebound, run the clock out and lose in overtime?  EDIT: [Well idk, I've never seen a hockey player grab a rebound in the dying seconds and skate it out of the offensive zone and act like he's a hero.](https://i.imgur.com/vj06Blw.png)LeBron is definitely leaving Jr high af.If the Cavs lose this game, JR will never live this down  Edit: and the Cavs lose in OT... man I feel bad for the Cavs right now. I‚Äôm sorry Cavs fans, I really am. This is one of the most frustrating losses I‚Äôve ever seen.Poor LeBron explaining basketball to a player in the finalsthis is honestly one of the worst plays of all time, like wtf is he focused on? i bet lebron looked at the scoreboard 20x between those 2 shots. Don't worry you guys.

J.R ‚ÄòI thought we won‚Äô SmithHE FUCKING DID THIS ON AN NBA FINALS GAME WTFThat might be the worst mistake in NBA history. Seriously. This pissed me off pretty bad.I am seriously furious right now  I have never been angrier at an athletehttps://i.imgur.com/ZQl84Z3.pngIs this the worst IQ basketball play ever? As far as magnitude?  Edit: Another play that comes to mind is Curry‚Äôs behind the back pass the year the Cavs won.Nobody ever tell me Lebron having bad teammates isn't an excuse after watching this.Is this the biggest fuck up of all time? JR you stupid bitchLay off the weeeeeeeeddduhhWhat JR just did was worse than Chris WebberHow does Ty Lue not call timeout there?   Edit: for people saying that LeBron was trying to call timeout, he can't. Only the player with the ball or the coach can. And I'm not talking about immediately after the rebound, I'm talking about after he starts sprinting to the 3pt line. The only person on the court that could have stopped this is Lue, and he did nothing.LMFAOOOOOhttps://i.imgur.com/B2jeVkq.jpgCleveland sports lore is filled with awful memories: The Fumble, The Drive, The Shot, The Decision, etc. However, in 2016, LeBron gifted us with The Block, and our misery subsided.   In 2018, up against the much-reviled GSW Warriors, we had a chance to steal game 1 on their home court and give the entire city and  basketball fans across the world reason to believe.   With 4.7 seconds remaining, George Hill clanks his second free throw and JR miraculously comes down with the rebound. Instead of calling the final timeout, or dishing to an open LBJ, JR dribbles out to damn near half court and lets time expire, resulting in overtime. LeBron, clearly frustrated, asks JR what he was thinking. "I thought we were winning," JR replies.   And so, for your consideration, I submit another in a long line of Cleveland's sports miseries: The Thought.He fooled me. I was celebrating until I looked at the score. This is the sole play that drives Lebron out of Cleveland Stupidest play in NBA history?I'm off the pipe God TrainDamn I just feel so bad for Lebron. Fuck man he deserves betterUn fuckingthe Warriors have 2 MVPs, multiple all-pros and all stars, LeBron has a dude who doesn't know the score of a finals game he is in Literally 1v9 holy shitIf Lebron wanted to go ahead and go to Houston, Philly, whomever after this game and forfeit the rest of the finals I would blame him.  Dude put up 51/8/8, had two fouls go against him in the closing minutes, had JR Smith forgetting the score of the game, and Jordan Clarkson refusing to pass the ball to Lebron at one point.   I have never witnessed someone solo carry so many bums against so many elite players at once and still almost win anyways. Dude played against the Warriors and his own teammates tonight.  Fuck everythingJR must have some sort of smoking mechanism in his mustache, taking hits at will, like when rebounding a potentially game winning free throwhttps://imgur.com/a/FKX3bPDLive by the JR, die by the JRJR is a burner player for the WarriorsYou can see him mouth "I thought we were ahead to lebron" smh he's so bad LeBron deserves so much credit for carrying a team of washed up JR and washed up Korver to the finalsAnd that was the last I ever saw of JR SmithTurned a great rebound into a terrible play. So frustrating to see. [When you thought you had the lead but didn't](http://i.imgur.com/xbmwW7d.jpg)Cavs got piped"We don't got a fucking squad now"  -LebronJR with the -200 IQ play.I was nearly expecting him to dunk it into the Warriors basket the way that idiot took off.4D chessShaq in a fool all time finals nominee Jesus.. Jr almost had 5 seconds to either shoot or pass.. He doesn't care.. His lack of focus is exceptional. Chris Paul is texting Lebron ‚ÄúI knew the game was tied‚Äù[deleted]I've seen a hell of a lot of real stupid plays in a lot of games in a lot of different sports. This was right up there with the absolute most ridiculously moronic things I've seen. So irritating. LeBron out there dropping 50+ while he's literally bleeding from his eye and JR can't be bothered to know the fucking score in crunch time. WTF.What a fucking moronSeriously, smoke more weed JRSomeone please gif that slow-mo replay of LeBron's reaction  Goddamn. The epitome of JR Smith - gets a clutch rebound üëçüèº forgets the game situation n runs to half court üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºFire ty lue before OT starts for not calling the timeouteven Noah couldn't carry these animals Lebron scores 50....and his teammates can't even read a scoreboard?Javale: aw geez img gonna get roasted for that missed layup  JR: hold my henny.J.R. isn't a good player and he has been carried through every playoff game. He does not care about the game. Watch him practice before each game. He spends half his warmup attempting underhanded half court shots.  Ty Lue is worse for letting him start every fucking game.That was legitimately one of the worst mistakes in NBA historyThat is one of the biggest fuck ups in nba history This literally makes me want to cry because I'm so sad for LeBron.Not a big lebron fan. But I feel for him on this one. They should have won. The rake on a steal and the reviewed block call against him.As much shit as he‚Äôs getting, you have to know that no one is being harder than JR Smith is on himself.  LOL JK he probably already forgot it happenedWhat if JR Smith saw 14 million possible outcomes and this is the only way the Cavs win this series?JR going into game 2: Feels good to be up 1-0WHAT THE FUCK JRDude is so fucking highThat‚Äôs the most JR thing I‚Äôve ever seen There's a scoreboard bigger than my house he could look at if he was at all unsure.[This is looking less and less like a parody.](https://youtu.be/d9HGjZd_Fm8)In every sport before the play you need to know the situation and go over in your head what you'll do if certain things happen. He should have already made the calculation that if he got the rebound to either put it back up, or kick it out to someone else. Not knowing the situation and what to do is inexcusable. It's pretty much the first thing they teach you in sports. Physical mistakes happen and are unavoidable, but there should never be mental mistakes in an NBA Finals game.I had that same thought. You could tell as soon as the game went to OT, the other Cavs we're like "fuck this." Dead in OT.Hell, JR might not come back after this.  Lebron could murder him in his sleep tonight and nobody would blame himi coulda shot it, hell i coulda passed, but i got highI was gonna look at the scoreboard, but then I got high Javale: I got this locked up  JR: wait just a second there>Shaqtin' a fool Champion 2018  Yep. Pack it up Retire the awardJavale so relieved right now.Delete the whole account Mods, do something YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHINGJust grab your keyboard and hold it for 4.7 seconds. I was going to make a burner account comment. But then thought "that's a stupid thing to respond with,  why would JR Smith have a burner account with his own name, that would be fucking stupid" Then I thought "oh".#GET HIMI think 1 year club is the real tragedy here for your name Just turn it into a novelty account that is completely oblivious to the current situation at all times.Also everyone will forget Javale's inexplicable missed dunk because of thisNick might be goofy, but JR is retarded.How the fuck do you not know that in the Finals.... I'm so mad at JRThat feel when you spend your life mastering basketball but you really should've been learning addition.[deleted]Damn, so unaware. LeBron has to be so disappointed How are you in the NBA finals and act like an ignorant pot head? Fuck JR  EDIT: I also smoke, people. Stop acting like the FDA is taking my comment into consideration. Is there video of this? For some reason I must hate myself and want to actually see it.  EDIT - I went back in the replay and grabbed it. Just wow...  https://streamable.com/xg5behttps://i.imgur.com/nbUZ9Ka.jpgRebound by JR SMITH! back to himself! What the fuck is he doing? Tie Game!Lebron should leave the cavs now. No one would be mad at him.  I mean literally now. Don't even shower. Just pack it up and go to Philly or LA after game 1Lebron got this man paid 12 million dollars a year to put them over the luxury taxJavale McGee and George Hill are lucky Jr did this. Now nobody will remember the 7 footer get blocked by the rim on a dunk and the 81% freethrow shooter missing the go ahead freethrowI don't blame Hill too much for this miss.  Super high pressure, he made the important one, and missed the second one in a way to get a rebound.Well he didHe absolutely did. With any basketball iq at all he just goes up with the ball and gets fouled, makes one foul shot and wins the game. Instead he gives the game away.https://media1.giphy.com/media/Fg22kcTuD29iw/giphy.gifwhy the fuck is he on the courthttps://gfycat.com/WelltodoQuaintCoypuChris Paul having flashbacks rnTruly classic JR  https://twitter.com/desusnice/status/419558313064665088/photo/1Hands down stupidest fucker in the league lmaoThis is something I would do. I once scored for the other team in my rec league. Slight difference is that it was not in the NBA finals and I hadn't been playing professional basketball for a decade. The same level of situational awareness you need to kill your friend in a car accident tbhWE TRAINED HIM WRONG, AS A JOKEThe first man to commit a C9 in the NBA. This is historyYou can't fool us, JR.I‚Äôve spent an inordinate amount of time laughing at this joke.YesShould you quickly duck sideways, dodge the claw, then take him out with a spinning back-kick, or take the claw in the face, then roll on the ground and die?Every possible thing you can think of is better than what happened. After this game.  He literally looked at him as if Smith was mentally damagedCan‚Äôt blame him. Two chances to win the game with the clock winding down and his two teammates let him down. JR wtfDid you see his reaction?  He‚Äôs tired of this amateur shit, he gone for sure. LeBron about to go to big baller league before he plays with JR againIf they lose he should leave and let the other Cavs fend for themselves in the next 3 gamesIt‚Äôs so unfair for this man to have these bums on his team. You go 51-8-8 just to have some fuckin loser miss the game winning free throw and then have your other teammate drunk off henny grab the rebound and run away from the basket. JR just doing JR thingshttp://i.imgur.com/xbmwW7d.jpgIf they win he shouldn't live it down either. You're not gonna get 50 pt nights out of LeBron every night and he needs to rest as much as possible 'cuz he's carrying some fucking bums through the playoffs.[deleted]That was our road win. We needed that shit The object of the game is to score more points than your opponent by the end of regulation. Infinity StonedJr. Strange LMAO, thanks I needed this to lift my spirits.You know some days I'm glad I'm an internet nerd and not a professional athleteOh, this made me sad. JR is going to get many death threats.JR you idiotWhile I see the humor, that is just painful for me to see. A guy who is literally putting everything he has into the game, only to see it pissed away by a buffoon. I can see the pain in his expression and it's tough for me to not feel absolutely gutted for him, even as a Celtic's fan.[This is the face of a man that has reached his limit.](https://imgur.com/gallery/NHGYTUp)You can feel the frustration lmaoI sense high meme potentialhttps://i.imgur.com/nbUZ9Ka.jpgwhat do you think james is thinking?this pic honestly makes me wanna cry for bron"When mom comes home to see you left the chicken still in the freezer"JR ‚Äúphilly confetti‚Äù smithJ.R 'OT Tonight' SmithFinal seconds of a Finals game when they could have won üòÇ Seriously. Less than 10 seconds left IN THE FUCKING NBA FINALS AND YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE SCORE IS. Fuck you This is the Chris Webber timeout but worse maybe.[removed]Maybe not a mistake, but Nick Anderson missed 4 insanely clutch free throws IN-A-ROW in the finals against Houston in 94 or 95.I'm straight saltyI'm fucking livid, cavs played just good enough only be shot in the foot by their own man. Me too. Fucking absurdly, incredibly, mind numbingly idiotic play. Beyond inexcusable.[COME ON!](https://i.imgur.com/xKsrIQa.jpg)https://i.imgur.com/SjTFaDN.jpg Think about this. Javale missed a wide open dunk and it is far and beyond from the stupidest play in this game.Right up there with Chris Webber‚Äôs ‚Äútime-out‚Äù against UNCLebron doesn't make his teammates better! He should have been screaming to JR that they weren't ahead before Hill even shot the ball so he knew!Literally already seen a comment to the effect of ‚ÄúLeBron got his boy paid, he‚Äôs partially to blame‚Äù like a) he is literally the GM of the Cavs and b) he should have known JR would literally forget how to look at a scoreboard.The only other contenders are the same mistake in non-finals games so...The only thing i can compare to is that football play when the reciver ran to his own touchdownI fucking love it when somebody brings [this](https://youtu.be/Cil7tOPh4qM) upTotally agree. Typically, the coaches tell you how many timeouts you have. I don't think any coach has to remind players about the score of the game LOLHe probably figures JR just couldn't get a shot up and was dribbling out to make some space or find a cutter. There were open shooters and even if JR passed up a decent look, Lue isn't gonna draw anything up that's better than the wide open look Lebron would have had if JR had passed it to him. By the time its clear how retarded JR is, it's too late. Ty Lue is on the other side of the court he can't get to an official in time. Because he is not a good coachThats what I was thinking tooIt's difficult to inbound the ball with a few seconds and get a good shot. Better off with defense scrambling to try and get something open.   edit: It may have been nearly 5 seconds when JR had the ball under the fucking rim but not after. He too was on that HennyMan this was infuriating. It's all fun and games And we laugh at him smoking weed and doing dumb shit on his own time but he possibly cost the Cavs a critical game.  Edit: Yep. JR ended up costing them the game. That play just completely killed their momentum and deflated them. They had a great chance to win the game if he takes a time out or attempts a put back after the rebound. Just anything but this.Somewhere in the world CP3 just got triggered Too much hennyHow many horrible bone-headed plays has he had these playoffs? Jesus ChristLebron can't win with these cats. He gone.  Fucking JR Smith...lolGod damn it, this game is over lolWhat a damn idiot you are JRYeah I knew the score but his stupidity momentarily made me think we won.Broke the leCamels backRon Artest ran into the stands during the middle of a game and beat the shit out of a fan, and what JR Smith did tonight was even more stupid than that.Gotta be He‚Äôs definitely gone. Hill missed free throw and this blunder by JR? Probably cost the series. LeGone.beAre you how the majority of Cavs fans feel?But mostly deathThey never lived by JR fucking Smith. Any average shooting guard would have been better than him.Idk how he‚Äôs on the floor in OT. Everyone knew they were about to lose anyway. Sit his ass down. Korver's had a bad game, but he's been good the whole playoffs. Solid as a role player. He's not even comparable to JR.This is way worse than the Webber timeout thing. Definitely worse, NBA finals on the road vs one of the best teams of all time vs college ball.It‚Äôs so much worse. This is the NBA finals you can‚Äôt do that here. I honestly think this was worseHe made the correct decision. He couldn't know JR would fuck it up so badlyfor real. how tf do you not have a contingency plan for the missed 2nd shot and rebound?Any team would lose after going through that fuckup.LeBron murdering JR would at least motivate guys like Jordan Crawson/Clarkford. LeReasonableCause LeBron is gooooonna leave, and I know why, hey hey[Says it all] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dek2e-5VQAAiELf.jpg)  edit: [HD] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dek9H3wU8AE1PEt.jpg) and for those who like [beef] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dek8Y5UUcAAyWs1.jpg)Javale breathes a sigh of reliefWe need the TNT crew more than ever right now :(Lifetime Achievement AwardHopefully it deletes jr tooThis deserves a custom flair...Shouldn't you worry about changing yours?I thought that was going to become the meme that summarizes the series and JR is out here like *hold my beer.*But he had some great defensive stops and a dunk before that, so it kind of evens out. JR just sucked Just a reminder that JR makes $13 millionNot even a Cavs fan and so mad. That legitimately might have cost them the series. He was point blank and could have at least drawn a foul.Fuck this guy. I'm nowhere near being a Cavs fan but he probably just robbed us of a great series.I'd be okay if they kicked him off the team after tonight. And going for the steal at the end of the half...fuckHe was probably in the corner eating glue during those lessons> mastering basketball  Are we thinking of the same JR Smith?[deleted]This is why he leaves the Cavs, shit like this when he drops 50 costing them a chance to steal a game LeBron wanted to kill his ass in the moment. The way he yells at him and storms off just screams that he‚Äôs fuming.> How are you in the NBA finals  LeBronThat‚Äôs his secret, Cap.  He‚Äôs not acting. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.I laughed but I‚Äôm sadi think he was trying to clear the ball‚ÄúAye when did they get KD‚Äùholy fuck, he played a game while being this fucking high?   or is he in some kind of medication.  Why would anyone hire someone this unreliable, specially when he isn't nearly as good as he should to tolerate that kind of shit.Ty Lue high too[deleted]I mean he got a rebound over Durantlmao, can you share the story behind this, I just started watching the nba this season I'm just imagining CP3 saying in that super low, slowmo voice, "Shoot the fuc...DJ! Shoot it! Fuckin' shoot...look at the clock...DJ! DJ!!!"Yeah but are you being paid $12.8 million annually?Pusha is that you?? And still keep getting multiple traffic violations even after that ordeal. Wow dude ran a stop sign going 67 in a 35 and only suffered scratches/injured shoulder after getting ejected from the car. Lucky sob.[deleted]Stop signs, game clocks, who cares about those.What's this about?Oh holy fuckWeeeeeeoooooooweeeeeeeoooooooI am bleeding, making me the victor.AGAIN with the squeaky shoes?!JR tried his My-Nuts-To-Your-Fist style.I'm really dumb, what's a C9?it's his burner, eric JRBest laugh of the night, right into my second worst cryThanks for clearing that up, thanks.Will just fly to Houston tonight, fuck the other gameshttps://imgur.com/YQOtztP LMAOHe very well could be after this incident.Because he fuckin is.  When I was saying he's stupid 2-3 years ago, I was buried in downvotes. By people who probably never watched him play, just saw some highlights of him shooting 3s.I don't even blame george hill that much. Freethrow misses happen .... the shit JR pulled is just fucking ridiculous JR just fucked up LeBron's 50+ point, all-time game and a chance to steal a game at home against one of the best teams ever. Fuck this has me pissed.  Edit: Also just watched an interview from him after the game last night where he said he dribbled it up top to get a better shot and saw LeBron trying to call a timeout so he just stopped. He‚Äôs a motherfucking liar because you can clearly see him tell LeBron after the buzzer sounded that he thought they had the lead. This stupidity is unforgivable. 3 if we count Kevin Love fouling Curry for the and-1 the play before when he had no chance at all to block the shot. He was calmly informing Mr. Smith he was going to the wrong sideNo way. He can‚Äôt wait to play with JR and Clarkson next season. https://imgur.com/YQOtztP  LMAOman this is beyond ameteur shit, some one with almost no knowledge of the game would of chucked it back up or immediately passedLoL should just rest for his next finals run next season. You cant win with these cats literally. Being his usual self right there I see.JR watching Lebron leave Cleveland and wonder whyLebron might score 50 every night thoIn order for this to be a close game LeBron has to score 50, cavs need to dominate the offensive boards, and KD has to suck. And they still lostIt's such a huge moment. Being able to take game 1 when your best player drops 50 and GSW shoot awful from 3.This is the Mark Sanchez butt fumble of the NBA, dude is donezo, hope he enjoys playing his last 3-5 games in the NBA.I think they needed to steal one on the road to win the series.  Might be jumping to conclusions but I legit think that blew their chance at winning the series. It's the face of realization that you are having a career game but it doesn't matter because you're surrounded by idiots and bums.With just the right amount of jpeg. I guess we have to thank JR for this.You can also feel Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúOh fuck‚Äùhttps://i.imgur.com/qKSvhn1.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/SyUy3yR.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/GX92a1p.jpgThat he's fucking out of Cleveland regardless of outcome this series. It's wayyyyy fucking worse. JR is a professional. Not knowing how many timeouts vs not knowing the score is also wayyyyy different. Not knowing the score of the game is worse than not knowing how many TOs your team has.Not knowing how many timeouts is more acceptable IMO, even if he was explicitly told in the huddle.  Not knowing the score... during free throws...Chris Weber was a freshman in college this motherfucker has over 10+ years of experience in the nba. God damn is he frustrating to watchI feel like this is worse just off the fact that Chris Webber had somewhat of an excuse. He was outside of the timeout huddle and couldn't hear his coach say they didn't have any timeouts, whereas JR should've been fully aware of the score, that's just boneheaded. *Skip furiously jotting this down* "This is perfect!"I see you've already written Skip's script for tomorrow> he should have known JR would literally forget how to look at a scoreboard.  Actually that part should probably be expected of JR.Or the wide open LEBRON JAMES at the top of the key. [deleted]Lebron is best coach I feel like not calling timeout was the right move here. There‚Äôs often a man left open in the post-rebound frenzy, as LeBron clearly was in this one, not Lue‚Äôs fault JR missed himI think he was hoping for a quick put-back shot. Great chance to score pissed away by JR.He changed the whole finals if they lose game 1  Getting up 1 on them at home does wonders on the mental side of thingsIdk how mark Jackson and jvg are being so "these things happen, I remember it happened in the 80s once huhuh" like no. Maybe it's happened before but its absolutely unacceptable to not know if you are ahead or tied in the closing seconds of a fucking nba finals game. Like what the fuck. Mark and Jeff are insufferable sometimes lol[SHOOT IT!!!](https://youtu.be/MuRgzqwt1J4)The Pipe God sends his regardsIf he tricked a warriors player into fouling him it would've looked pretty slick.LeeAnd one is a college kid...the other is a millionaire pro. Yeah, I saw the rebound and was ecstatic. Just go back up with it, get fouled, win the game off one foul shot. But then he ran it out and I cried.Worse than a premature confetti drop.Jordan- "Ahh 30 minutes to get 2 points...I'm ready to go in coach." Because I got high, because I got high, because I got hiiigghhhhThis has meme potential.I was honestly mad *for* LeBron there. That had to be the biggest knucklehead move a player has pulled since Josh Howard called a timeout during the 2006 Finals after one free throw was shot.The world needs this gif. This moment to when James realizes he is talking to someone with the IQ of a rutabaga and just gives up. Man the anguish on his face. Omfg I'm dying on the 3rd one lmfaoHe deserves an honorable mention for that dunk attempt. lolDam, that got dark real quick. You mean delete delete JR, or delete him from Cavs?I vote for [this](https://i.imgur.com/aRsK8OI.jpg)> *hold my ~~beer~~ henny*  FTFYTo blaze before games$13mil buys a lot of weed. Point provenNow I know why Marcus Smart wants more than $14 million. this is the first basketball game I've watched in years and I was madI'm an Australian man who never watches or pays attention to the NBA and I am furious.Cavs were set for a historic play and JR just...... ForgotIf I were a Cleveland fan I would have broken something lmao. That was so stupid That play might have cost them the remainder of Lebron‚Äôs career The series went from potentially 7 to a likely sweep in 4 seconds One hour later I'm still sitting on my couch in shock that actually happenedIt was his all time playoff record. Crazy that, that 51 pt performance is not even the headliner. JR messed it upOh, it'll be remembered- probably encapsulates the LBJ- Cavs experience like nothing elseJR did not wanna lock eyes with Lebron's disappointed dad face when they got to the bench.  JR knew he was gettin' a whoopin when he got home. Can LeBron be really penalized by NBA if he just straight up whooped JR ass right after buzzer? Pretty sure cleveland coaching staff would be ok with it I feel bad for him. Score 50 and still lose bc of a dumbass and NBA players that forgot how to shoot. I feel so empty bruh lmaoHe and Klay both: "Whoa, when did Harrison Barnes grow a beard??"If I remember correctly, he was asked about this and had just gotten hit in the head and he was trying to shake it off.    Or, he‚Äôs like man, I play for the knicks, I‚Äôm getting high afTo legit answer you, it's a reversed gif. It's not nearly as weird looking if you reverse the reversal, and Shump usually walks forward.

CP3 just gonna send him this post to convince him lmaoLebron convinces Silver to let him sign with Houston, and change the rest of the Finals to GSW/HOU"What the FUCK, man?????"I thought I'd laugh when I first clicked,  but fuck, I just feel like shit seeing the pain and anguish on that man's face. Damn this is a ready made meme!Thats the smartest player in NBA history trying to comprehend the thought process of a high and drunk dachshund SONThis is going to be a historic picture of the exact moment that Lebron James, once again, decides to leave the hellhole known as Cleveland.How do you sleep after this.Yeah if hill misses both and doesn't tie its a choke but hitting one was the biggest deal. Running away from the basket though... That's some shitIn a way, missing that FG actually helped the Cavs (of course all dependant on getting the rebound). Because Warriors with 4.5 seconds and a TO and only down by 1 is not a great spot. Id rather be tied with 3 seconds and the ball.My thoughts exactly. Yeah Hill should've hit his free throw and the Cavs should be up by 1 but free throw misses happen and thats life. However, getting the offensive rebound under the rim and NOT knowing what the score is in such a big moment is utterly absurd. Smith must have one of the lowest BBIQ of all time. Missed out on a taco too.Well he wouldn‚Äôt have got to 50 if it didn‚Äôt go to OT, but I feel you. For me its just letting your teammates down and being so unfocused in a finals game. Unacceptable  As a fan I could almost feel his disappointment in everyone around him. You can almost feel the ‚Äúfuck this shit, I‚Äôm out‚Äù vibe. I don‚Äôt blame him. He has a bunch of bums around him right now, his owner is a clown, and there are no redeeming qualities to the city of Cleveland.  Love doesn't foul Steph if JR doesn't get blown by like he was standing still. KLove was doing a better job guarding Curry and Durant than JR. "Actually, Mr. Smith, it was tied. It would have been better to score and win. That's okay though. It's only game 1. Shit happens buddy!"JR [wat u doin???](https://imgur.com/a/KnJIb9O)"Hey, Hey JR? You're going the wrong way bud"I don't get how Clarkson gets so many minutes. He has some of the worst shot selection I've ever seenIf you're trying to imply that his teammates are literally as good as a team full of house cats, then you're right. You misunderstand, that's a real time picture of his face on that playThe Warriors really had no answer.  Couldn't even slow him downIn order to even get to OT, Steph had to make a deep buzzer beater, Hill had to miss a game winning free throw, and JR smith had to run out the clock of a tied game. You can always do this for both teams loltfw when you're 1 point away from winning a legacy-defining game. But your point guard misses a FT and the other guard dribbles it away from the basketEven more than just a career game. They probably just lost the series. They had a chance if they could snatch a game in Oakland and hold home court. Now their moral is shot. Wouldn't be surprised if at least a majority of the remaining games play out like OT.This is fucking juicyI can‚Äôt believe someone made a meme this good this fastAlso at least one of Webber's teammates on the bench was yelling at him to take a timeout. I doubt anyone in the arena besides JR didn't know the score in this circumstance.To be fair to Webber, he did have like 2 or 3 guys on his bench screaming at him to call a timeout and he was like 18 or 19 at the time too. Most guys at that age in that magnitude of a game would probably fuck that up.And half of Webbers team was screaming at him to take a time out, right next to himPlus this isn't his first finals. He's been here before so many times. Can't blame his nerves And a player on the bench screamed at him to call the timeout. Shit, even if you're running out the clock, that's who you pass the ball to anyway.But ^Lebron ^^tried ^^^to  ^^^^call ^^^^^timeoutI dont know how LeBron didnt yell at JR smith face right there on the court , i would have choked him lolAlso who knows how many games like this LeBron has in him in this series. Even for LeBron that was insane, what a complete wasteNo joke this might be the stupidest thing I've ever witnessed in an NBA game given the context.Too bad the Warriors employ professional basketball players.VaDurant was confused as hell chasing JR all the way out to half court, like, "dog, where are we going right now?"Worse because at least it wasnt the players that fucked up.LA LA LA LA LA LA LAbron ~Fuck you guys lol, take my upvotes.r/memeeconomy has never seen a meme gain traction so fast [We've already circled past memes into memeing memes with this meme](https://twitter.com/natt0/status/1002399608746545153).Lebron: "Is this an NBA player?"[As you were saying?] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dek6RLIUEAAS7LH.jpg)And that was something I had blocked out. Thanks for thatr/watchpeopledieinsideYou know what he meantYesNeeds more jpeg.> *hold my ~~beer~~ ~~henny~~ blunt*  > > *hold my ~~beer~~ henny*  FTFYThat‚Äôs no shit. Biggest stoner moment I‚Äôve ever seen. How do you fuck up that bad? I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt watch this game now, shit stresses me too much.JR smokes indica, Klay smokes sativa.I mean Klay gets is doneThis is my first night out of jail in years and I'm mad [deleted]He got high and just kind of wandered off JR gonna need a SWAT escort when they get back to Cleveland.Didn‚Äôt break something but I did aggressively knock some  movies off the shelf and scare my catI can't even imagine what Cavs fans must be feeling man, holy shit what a bullshit end. Fuck everything about that ending. Kanye better drop that album or I'm gonna go berserk.Yeah, this could be similar to Toronto throwing game 1. You could see it in OT, the Cavs were done. I don't think they'll recover from this.Count*Relevant username then I guesshttps://i.imgur.com/3PhOvAK.gifvNah man, watch the dude with the water in the background.[removed]Oh me oh mydude i don't even really watch basketball but this blew my mind. i feel so bad for himThat's UnnnnnBelievable.  Damn that sucks I don't blame him for getting confused by the buzzer thoughtick tick tick. how much time he got???Wow, I was totally unaware of this. This happened before I started watching and enjoying basketball. I'm coming! Wow man.  I just got into overwatch, thanks for showing me this!I can see his final argument just being a framed picture of JRafter this game, he doesn't need anymore convincingThis is the best outcome for LeBron, Houston, the sport, and the American people.JR YOU NOT HOOPIN GIVE ME YOUR RINGÔªø  It's that visceral type of anguish that when JR realized his colossal fuck up he probably knew he would be shunned for life by LeBronIt's as if JR Smith offered to housesit for Lebron for a week and forgot to feed his hamsterI'm not a Cavs fan, I'm a little bit of a Warriors fan, but damn, it's hard seeing LeBron carry an entire team and then they can't even do this.borderline cryingBOIHe tryin to give the pipe[deleted]I'd rather be up. Give them 5 seconds to win a game or 5 minutes.man absolutely, i was nervous that he WAS going to hit the 2nd FT. then i cheered then i slumped over onto the floor in despair Priorities. No shit. This guy is a professional.  It's totally inexcusable to unaware of the score.And NEVER passes the ball.  EVER.[removed]Iggy's absence was brutally apparent.   Although this is the second series in a row where a team has adapted to their switch-everything-always defense, so I guess even with Iggy there he'd be switched off Lebron a fair amountLmao even Warriors fans are pissed at JR, I love itThis is the stupidest play in sports history Ble?Lmao he started slowing down after a few steps too like ‚Äúwait really? All the way out there?‚ÄùGod gave us two hands for a reason. I scared my dog yelling timeout at the tvI dunno man...I think JR is just straight up dumb. He always makes boneheaded plays.[deleted]I was gonna win Game 1, but then I got high,   I was gonna take that ball and run, but then I got high.   I squandered LeBron's effort, and I know why - Why man?-   Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high.Oh hes gone. If they dont trade or waive him im absolutely applying to be a front office employee in cleveland. How hard can it be?I legit felt sick watching OT. I don't think I can watch this fucking series god damn JR how fucking high are you Currently at airport, screaming from all over the terminal when that happened."Holy shit. My cat came into my room to eat a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and knocked some movies off the shelf. She started meowing and staring at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my cat but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck did the Cavs lose? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe JR is so dumb. I want a future to believe in. I want LeBron to be president and fix this broken league. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was playing well in Oakland???? This is so fucked."If only the game was at Cleveland that home crowd would've eaten him alive I‚Äôm irrationally angry and upset over this and I‚Äôm a Knick fan.it's still weirdWhich one? I feel bad for Deandre because he seems like a big dumb golden retriever that was just happy he had the ball in his mouth and doesn't understand why his human is yelling at him.jr got ejected from a car at 60+ holy shitWelcome to the game! Watch OWL, it‚Äôs fun. I would have just walked off the court right then and there.   Fuck OT, fuck the next game, fuck the series, fuck waiting for off season, and fuck everything.   I'm outta there. Just gonna go home to Akron and start taking calls while watching the warriors crush the rest of the Cavs 200 - 46 each game.and the eastern conference  imagine if Lebron finally left the east, every other team would rejoice.   Maybe the Raps will finally have a chance now.MATTA FACK GIMME YO JERSEY. HIGH LOOKIN ASSIt's as if JR said he'd keep an eye on his bag but Bron came back and JR said "swear to God it was there a minute ago!"I typically agree, but against this Warriors team with no fouls to give, at home? I dunno man.Low BBIQ as well. Glad he's off the Lakers.Just dribbles around out of control and then jacks up a terrible shot.Yeah, and it came really close. The Warriors roster is stacked compared to the Cavs. Lebron was ridiculous this game the only answer was literally Lebron's teammates letting him down. Chance to win it with free throws, nope. Chance to get a shot off and win it, nope. Dude played the whole game and was gassed in OT so just needed a little help, nope.They didn‚Äôt win it. JR Won it. GoodbyeI‚Äôm not a big fan of either team, but I like the Cavs slightly more, probably still would have thrown something lolThis is the first of June and I'm madI'm Bryan Colangelo and I'm mad.What are your qualifications?  I'm not retarded.  *Whispers to other interviewer*  "Shit, this guy is good."Literally what I thought too LOL. SAVE IT FOR LATER JR YOURE IN THE FINALS.   This mofo gonna cost them the series LOL by godWorking in China this week. I was in the office sneaky watching on ESPN with vpn. JR runs back and there‚Äôs an audible groan in the office. Apparently I wasn‚Äôt the only one and chinese IT know more about basketball than JR Smith. [Donovan Mitchell literally just tweeted the same thing](https://twitter.com/spidadmitchell/status/1002395027497091072)This one is a more justifiable than JR for sure. You should always just go up with the ball, but I understand how the shot clock going off can be confused with the buzzer at the end of the gameFuck that dude, Air Bud would have had that putback don't you dare disrespect golden retrievers by comparing DeAndre Jordan to themCan confirm. Is fun.Look what the Celtics did without Kyrie.  I feel like the East is spoken for for the foreseeable future. actually lets move houston to the eastern conference while we're at it ;)Bruh hella shur RDCWorld1's gonna have a field day with this gameBut is it lower than JR's?This might be crazy, cuz he was definitely a gunner for us but god it didn‚Äôt seem this bad. Maybe that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre bad but I remember watching him and it looked better than it looks now "Under "Experience" on your resume, it's just a picture of a frog riding a unicycle."  "I am dat boi."  *both interviewers whisper under their breath in unison*  "^Oh ^shit ^whaddup."When can you start? The other confusing thing on the play is the game clock stops at 0.7.*without HaywardJR doesn't have an IQ.Just bbq

r/nba, Shaq so insecure he frantically doing research to go at this guy GOOGLE ME AN-DEHShaq legit hurt after this[deleted]Oh no he didn‚Äôt "He got me," Shaq said of Yang's comment over him. "That f**king Yang boomed me." Shaq added, "He's so witty," repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Yang to the list of people he would remind had no rings this summer. The Big Aristotle outwitted once again.Andy Yang u a goatMajor OofWhy did you have to have such a bad title with such a good post?Not sure if true, but Andy posted a picture in the comments section of Barkley shaking his hands and congratulating Andy for burning the big guy!Call it Kobe cause he always carried your big ass too.  *let the downvotes begin* Oof /r/MurderedByWords Cheers Daniel GeorgeSo the hack a Shaq is still a viable play.I will always remember the year KG, Cassell, and Sprewell took on Shaq and Kobe in the Western Conference Finals.   The town... both Minneapolis and St. Paul... was Electric.Press F to pay respects It should absolutely be called BBQ Chicken https://media.giphy.com/media/13D90nlAuPEIM0/200w.gifI wonder if he'd be more hurt by yhe original comment or how bad these comments are roasting him for being sensitive.[Shaq called the police on that user](https://deadspin.com/virginia-man-calls-cops-after-hard-screen-in-pickup-b-1827659622)Free throw it is then.Why is there already so much gold in this thread lolWhat kind of boat is that ?‚ÄúHe got me,‚Äù Shaq said of Andy's roast on him. ‚ÄúThat f**king Andy boomed me.‚Äù The Big Diesel added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so good,‚Äù repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Andy to the list of facebook users he makes memes with this summer.Thanks for putting the punchline in the title dipshitTWWWWOOOOOO BEEEEEEEEERSSSSSS INNNNNNIn the comments, he posted a pic of him and Chuck and said Charles cogratulated him personally lmaoIt looks like he has stopped listening to his financial advisor https://youtu.be/wMpZgt6agpUThere‚Äôs been a murder. Ouch! Too soon!surprised nobody suggested KoBuoyancy Bryant[deleted]"I am gonna name this boat Andy's Mom"For a really big guy he‚Äôs the most butt hurt and insecure little bitch i know.

Now you gotta name the boat Andy Yang. shaq after reading that  https://media.giphy.com/media/DC5kcx5hzxvvW/giphy.gifIf that's your boat...  It's definitely gonna sink. *OOF*r/murderedbywordsThat‚Äôs the best burn on Shaq!  He definitely won‚Äôt have a come back for this!üòÇüëè Bravo!dj shaqBurnActually a bad idea because there's a ~~45%~~ 52% chance it would sink.make one miss one ernehHe should name it "3-pointer" cause he'll only have one of those his whole life.Shaq jumps in the ocean 'it burns , it burns!'ROASTEDUnderdog put that on a t-shirt Shaq could never clapback on this guy. LMAO Bravo!Boaty McBoatfaceBESTSimilar story, i name all the pokemon I'll never use 'salad'.

Shaq flashbacks Yeah having a yacht at the expense of being bad at free throws sounds like a really cool trade off to meShaq still got a yacht. So who really took the L here? My favorite euphemism for someone being nervous is and always has been "Sweating like Shaq at the foul line" well he ain‚Äôt wrong....DAYUUUUUUUUM‚ÄúRings Andeh‚ÄùImagine KD and Shaq getting roasted Comedy Central style without the ability to respond. They might both spontaneously combust   Edit:Thank you for my first gold in 6 years!"I can't sink a free throw but I can sink my dick in your mom"GOOGLE ME ANDYWatch this old roast Jeff Ross did on Shaq back in the day. Hilarious, and some of the jokes probably wouldn't fly today.   https://youtu.be/qzts4Q_ak3E  Edit: 02:30 mark is where the Shaq jokes start This is [one of my favorites](https://i.imgur.com/XNOi7XK.gifv). Just cause he looked so confident.   Edit: Here is the one I meant [to link](https://i.imgur.com/n2XG6st.gifv). I‚Äôm an idiot. Although since I did an edit and screwed up I might as link [my favorite dunk](https://i.imgur.com/v5sJvMm.gifv)[Broussrard] Sources: Shaq is beside himself. Driving around the Pier begging (thru texts) the internet for the address to Andy's homeAndy Yang!  How my ass taste?You set me up, AndehResearch requires effort. Shaq will just drop a "Well, I sank my junk in your mama last night" and call it a day.‚ÄúPusha, I need you.‚ÄùHow else will he find dude's house to apologizeGoogle meKD warningBarkley would have taken that suggestion if he was a bad FT shooter.Shaq is going to go full Elon Musk on that guy."Google me Andeh"Is Shaq known for being insecure? Why did he play a part in a film that made fun of his ability to shoot free throws? Fun fact he tried to have child porn planted on the computer of someone who found out he was having an affair Shaq gets his feelings hurt all the time, but he definitely can take a joke from time to time. I bet he chuckled at this. He‚Äôs never really tried to claim he was a good free throw shooter, post career, at least.Shaq kinda find a way to make it bout Dwight.EXCUSE ME AN-DEH HOW MANY RINGZ DO U HAVE? Did Charles Barkley just give you gold?[I googled him and found this](https://media1.tenor.com/images/888e76eec54bc8f798c6fe49113eb8e1/tenor.gif?itemid=4872758)I‚Äôm convinced Shaq is lurking. Or someone texted him with all this gold on pro Shaq stuff. Or the hardcore Shaq fans are showing up. Hey Andy, tell me how my ass taste!when inside the nba comes back shaq is gonna get back at him At least he won‚Äôt be drowned though Looking at his boat, can safely assume shaq ain't ever feeling hurt again lolWho‚Äôs more insecure Durant or Shaq? Be prepared to see Shaq saying this when the NBAonTNT squad brings this up September Yes he did. Click Click, Shaq, welcome to your Kodak Moment!r/murderedbywordsAnd so, Andy Yang went outside and sat by the pool while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  "I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, I boomed him. I boomed Shaq,'" he said. "'I'm so good.'"   &nbsp;       O'Neal later went on to name his boat "Shaqqy McShaqface"he's so witty lmaoSo I have a question about this meme.  Some people write "He's so good"x4. But does the original quote mean that LBJ said "He's so good" for grand total of four times, or does this mean he said this originally once, AND THEN repeated this four times more? If it's the other case, wouldn't it be x5?  I am just trying to get my degree on memeology if anyone is curious why I am doing this.I saw this meme for the first time, this afternoon, over in r/politics and had to learn there that it came from here. I don‚Äôt know the OP source of this, but i love it. Where does copypasta this come from?While he wiped sweat from his face Out-pricked the Big Cactus[deleted]We can't all be creative.So that you‚Äôd comment? That‚Äôs all I got. Just calm....[We‚Äôll figure this out together.](https://i.imgur.com/QZlpxwx.mp4)Punchline in the title should result in an immediately removal and reposting by whatever mod found it.  Harsh, yeah, but it would stop this punchline-ruining epidemic site-wide What was your title going to be?Yeah I honestly thought this would either be a compilation of bad free throw forms we had to make creative names for or a like Pokemon thing where it shows bad free throw forms and we had to guess which player it isFound it! http://i.imgur.com/B2XOBcZ.jpgIf I got a penny for every time someone said Shaq carried Kobe on this sub, I would be making a g league salary. That‚Äôs funny, but not really true. I‚Äôm conflicted.If Sam didn't hurt himself doing the big balls dance we might have had a shot.FKlay was sorting by new and found it early [deleted]Looks like a 2009 PJ150 (Palmer Johnson)  Edit: seems to be the 2007 PJ150 called GREY MATTERS. Currently for sale and being chartered.   Had hull work done a few weeks ago in Nassau, Bahamas. Used to be a reddit rule, not sure what happened.If Yao came into today's league he would have develop such a nice 3 pt game.No wonder you still haven't responded to my friend request Broke: using Facebook  Woke: deleting Facebook   Bespoke: shitposting on Reddit about deleting Facebook.give him his respect, it's Dr. ShaqFlawless.Still Shaq lol"grmgmlblmglmgmg takin' over the **fuck**in Yang.""Google me, Andy! Google me!"This what I expected from the top 2 responses and I‚Äôm not disappointed.lmfaocould someone explain please?Literally spat out my coffee over thisThis is one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever read onlineüòÇ thanks for the laughKD, you're 6'11'' and you weigh 90 pounds. Gumby has a better body than you. Boom roasted. Shaq, you crush your wife during sex. Boom roasted. Charles Barkley, I can't decide between a fat joke or a dumb joke. Boom roasted. Shaq's been roasted a couple of times, I believe. He was the subject of a Pay Per View roast in 2002 and none other than Bill Simmons had a running diary of the event - http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/020416  Shaq was on the deus for the Beiber roast and got murdered."I know big n***a, regular dick"[Shaq rn](https://youtu.be/TsMLeIiL5AM)> "I can't sink a free throw cus yo momma so fat, her mouth is a black hole."[Relevant](http://teamcoco.com/video/conan-highlight-adam-sandler-shaq-junk)> I‚Äôm kidding Shaq, you were great in The Green Mile  >Troy Aikman wanted to be here Shaq, but he got a concussion opening the invitation.   SavageHe seemed in good spirits the entire time, although none of the jokes really went against his basketball talent.  Most were just jokes about his terrible movies, crude black jokes and how big he isI saw Jeff Ross live a couple years ago, he still says shit just as bad if not worse.racism is hilarious*Wipes off palms* that'll do the trickNot Shaq but I getchu How did you so badly link the wrong thing that was also somehow a similar topic? LolI counted a grand total of 2.5 pixels Oh man young Magic Shaq was something special. It was like he hadn't quite been tamed yet, just a fucking huge kid with crazy post gameHe's known for always bringing up his championship rings whenever he gets into a debate with his fellow analyst Charles Barkley, among others. He is made fun of because he cannot construct a well thought argument without needing to mention that he has rings while Barkley doesn't (which doesnt mean anything in most of their debates)Andy Yang  - - -  Andy Yang, also known as **The Ringmaster**, was born August 17th, 1987.  Considered a prodigy in his field^^[1][2][3][4] , he is widely considered as the greatest crafter of gold ring jewelry in the modern world.[You‚Äôll like this then](https://youtu.be/1tF2dF67Q2c)Shaq, that's turribleJ-ROC's MomOh no he didn‚Äôt!! And thats how I beat Shaq......it promptly sankhe's so witty lmaoFirst step is to eradicate all logic.  You failed your first test."He got me," /r/nba said of /u/pbang0529  comment over them. "That f**king /u/pbang0529  boomed me." /r/nba added, "He's so smart," repeating it *five* times. They then said he wanted to add /u/pbang0529 to the list of people they wanted to shitpost with this off-season.BroNah, "He's so [X], repeating it four times" could just as easily be interpreted as saying that LBJ said it 4 times total, not once and then 4 times after that.A Lebron quote after game 7 when Tatum boomed himI‚Äôm sorry you visited r/politics . That place is essentially a bunch of people that are interested in talking about people that could care less what they think. They defend certain Politicians like they are family or some shit. LeBronout-pricked the big ~~cactus~~ shaqtusMajor OwieJust write Shaq got a boat or something lol it's not a big deal just don't get why people put punchlines as titles This is like "watch yo profamity" but with dogsOMG OP I love you. That gif was perfect and really cute Don't name it backboardWhat a fucking living legend yangSometimes this timeline isn't so bad I mean Shaq carried Kobe hardMissed opportunity for a Penny jokeuhhhhh....what was the predictor for a successful Lakers season?  Kobe on the floor, or a competent presence in the paint?  HINT : IT'S NOT KOBE> If I got a Penny Hardaway  FTFY.FThe top three comments under best are lolHow much?After a quick and non-thorough google search, I'm estimating this purchase would cost him about 3.2% of his net worth (~13m/~400m). Maybe I'm just frugal, but that seems like a lot of money to throw at a boat. Not to mention what the ongoing expenses of owning a yacht must be.Don't be a noob my dude. You gotta poke me first, and then send a friend request. That's the waveShaq, we're live.Must be out of the loop on this one. What in tarnation are you guys referring too?"I did, that's the problem." - Andy. Probably.Incredible how well that fits Dammit I miss Michael ScottISAIAH...where‚Äôs Isaiah? Oh sorry I couldn‚Äôt see you behind that GRAIN OF RICE! Boom roasted/r/unexpectedtheofficeGumby body lmfaoooooThat's enough ErnehWhat is that ‚Äúboom roasted‚Äù from it sounds so familiar like a tv reference or somethingTnt is gonna hire you today.Damn I love The Office. I love you too!This is the single greatest comment on Reddit come at me. When i think of Shaq getting roastedi think of this roast by Counter-Strike commentator [Thoorin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSWTqAUBMyk). Starts around 1:30. BONUS: Chuck speaks about brothers speaking with English accent. Later Thoorin said that Shaq was really mad after that joke, didn't even want to shake hands with thim later.Was hilarious. Here‚Äôs the [Full Roast](https://youtu.be/ow5poWDvey8) if anyone is bored tonight and you have an hour or so. wait a second, was this before Simmons officially took the job as a writer for Kimmel? Is it possible he is praising jokes that he helped write here? Might have the timeline off, but comment seems like they aren‚Äôt connected   [BS on Kimmel](https://imgur.com/gallery/oYFjm4r) Oh god we're not making this a thing are weBN, RDYo momma so fat, Thanos had to clapShaq I could see that your knuckles are scraped.  Did you happen to walk here today? Holy shit‚ÄúCrude black jokes‚Äù   Come on bro it‚Äôs a roast. Nobody is safe at a roast. Everything goes. Even racist jokes. I can send you a million videos of black roasting whites at these events. It‚Äôs all for good and fun nothing serious mate Which I don't mind, to be honest. People take shit wayy too seriously  When I see that black peoples in his comedic community respect and love him then I don‚Äôt think anyone has a problem with it. It‚Äôs the ones with bad intent that deserve shaming Not really, but witty jokes are What is wrong with me today!*It slipped. I swear*I'm sorry but I think you'll find that the true Ring GOAT is Sauron.RINGZZZ ANDEHH RINGZZZYou know, in my day, I dated a black fella or twoBut he did. Have you ever watched Shaq attempt free throws? The rhythm, the physics, the release, they're all wrong. It's the wrong form. It's like taking a linebacker and having him attempt a field goal. In tennis. If you focus on the backboard, and cut out the part of him making the shots, it looks like the ball could have come from anywhere. Including a crashing helicopter.he's so witty lmaoThere‚Äôs no place more logicaller than /r/nba. Why is this stupid fucking pasta so damn funny every time üòÇNo no no! If he said it and then repeated it 5 times, thats a total of SIXSorry for booming you. x4/5Real nephew hoursThat f**king Tatum, mind you.Ty>a bunch of people that are interested in talking about people that could care less what they think.   ...yep.  completely different from r/nba."When do we start locking up all Republicans to protect our democracy?!"  "Round up the GOP fascists and put them in a camp. There is no other solution."  "Reddit is run by alt-right admins in the pocket of Russia. That's the only explanation for why TD exists."  etc etc.Its pretty entertaining if you treat it like a zoo. Dont jump in the exhibit with the crazy people Yeah i feel ya. I just watch it to keep up on times to see when/if Donnie is gonna go down. What he‚Äôs doing to our country is an equal mix of terrifying and embarrassing. r/politics is awful. I identify near their political range but if you deviate even slightly or ask them for sources for their crazier shit then it's a circlejerk against you. Fucking hate that sub.u right I goofedMajor My Bones.I prefer OP‚Äôs title but you do you!"Shaq got a boat" would've been an interesting title cause the image would surprise everyone[deleted][deleted]I don't why this is denied. Shaq was by far the best player on those teams.Do you think the Lakers could have won any of those 5 championships without Kobe on the floor?Penny Hardaway was the first thing I thought when reading that comment, yet here you are in downvote town. My condolences.wutIs this Dwight Howard?FIt's for sale for about $12mWhen you own as many businesses as Shaq this is like buying a new car. yeah but at some point you want to live man. He doesnt have THAT many years left for that money to appreciate. Let him buy a boat, just dont buy 2Ive been ~~sucking~~ poking you hard already[deleted]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajcY_MJHLng/u/ItypeRandomWords you've slept with so many men you're starting to look like one.

Nice thanks for sharing This roast is where Jamie Foxx absolutely ended this black comics career too. Fuckin hilarious. If Wikipedia is to be believed, he didn't start working for Kimmel until April, 2003, so more than a year after the Shaq roast in question.  > Simmons left Boston and moved to California on November 16, 2002[58] and began working in April 2003[59] as a comedy writer for the show  > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons#Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!off season, end of summer league and we on r/nba.  Every thing is a thing homie.Where'd this one come from?Shitposting szn pleighboiDaaaamni don't get it :(Oh for sure, I think he's hilarious. Shaq was the butt of the gorilla joke and he was laughing at it, so in my mind there is no reason for anyone to get offended on his behalf.He usually hits those.. free throws.*stares at one finger to examine super serious injury I‚Äôve had this entire time***Filmography and Bibliography**  - - -  Yang was cited by J.R.R.

I WANNA BE A BALLA, LOGICALLER 20 INCH BLADES ON MY KATANASThe best pastas are always the ones with several moving parts and with multiple opportunities for creativity.  This meme, (thru texts), and we got a [expletive] squad now exemplify this fact.Hey /u/pbang0529. When you gonna boom me.Now you're just vacillating.Is he good?There was a post here a few days ago about younger ball players reporting being self conscious about negative comments they see on social media. /r/politics - "kill all conservatives!"  /r/The_Donald - "kill all liberals"  /r/nba - "kill golden state"I come here so I don‚Äôt have to see this shit.> Yeah i feel ya  Kinda sounds like you don't Problem is OPs title is already the punchline of the image, so the title ideally should be related but not exactly it. In Shaqs prime he carried everyone, Penny, Kobe and DWade. Is it really a shock that 2 guards flourished when you had Kazaam throwing Chris Dudleys of the league to the floor every night? That double team opened the floor up. No disrespect to those guys, they're all time greats and my love to Kobe knows no bounds, but it was always Shaq #1.> KobyYeah let‚Äôs just forget Pau mf Gasol exists real quick It's not like he spent his career with Parker and Brown. It was 3 seasons and he made the finals in 4th. We have no way of telling if he would have won a ring over 05 Spurs or Pistons, 06 Suns, Spurs, Mavs or Heat and 07 Spurs or Suns.Prime Shaq is better than 2nd term Cleveland lebron. Thats ridiculous. For one, the supporting cast on that 06 Heat team is way worse than the worst supporting cast Kobe ever won with.Shaq is a better player than Kobe regardless.  Just didn‚Äôt last as longHe was by far the best player the first year of the three-peat. They were even after that with Kobe arguably having a better playoffs in 01 despite Shaq winning the Finals MVP because Kobe was allowed to feast and carry the Lakers through the West while Shaq was busy banging with Sheed/Sabonis, Divac/Webber, and Duncan/Robinson en route to a much easier finals matchup (Mutombo could never really guard Shaq because of Shaq's mass and the other bigs the Sixers had were complete stiffs like Todd MacCulloch).Absolutely.  Had they traded Kobe for Duncan straight up in 98, they would've won ten.  Specifically, they would have won the 2004 championship if only Kobe had not been there building brick cathedrals.  That was the series that showed me that it was more important to Kobe to be the best 1-on-1 basketball player of all time than to win basketball games.  And he's probably up there.  Best 1-on-1 of all time.  Unfortunately, the NBA is 5-on-5.Thanks for the support, haha.These fools don't remember the magic that was Penny. FI'll add it to my Amazon wishlist. Maybe in a few months after my checks all clearTrue enough. And I'm sure he'll sell it at some point. As they say, the two best days of a boat owner's life are the day he buys a boat and the day he sells a boat.~~suck~~ poke harder my dudeYo, Andy, tell me how my ass tasteHoly shit, lol. This string of comments makes so much sense now. Thanks!"something wonderin why the league is losin money, that's why.

"I know."Incredible how well that fitsu/Bumblebee__Tuna, the Spurs called. They think you suck. And you're gayer than u/ItypeRandomWords. Boom roasted. From what I‚Äôve heard he is really into bulls.

He's so good. He's so good.Right, that would be when he officially started writing for him, but it seems close enough in time that they could have potentially developed a relationship prior to the actual move...  ...or he just thought Kimmel was a funny guy and that made the decision to work with him easier. Not that this is really any different than the regular seasonThe comments from a few days ago on the post about Adam Sandler trying to see Shaq‚Äôs dick. He's implying he moves like a gorilla who uses their knuckles to walkPuts on soft cast... ‚ÄúI‚Äôve basically been playing with a broken hand this whole time.‚ÄùTolkien's modern day descendant J.R Tolkein-Smith has reported interest in writing a biography of Yang rumored to be called Rangs with Yang ^[31].Can I remind you how many rings I have now?I fucking hate how much I love this sub so goodI was kidding, but yeah. That and KD in general.I think r/The_Donald would be just as happy if we killed the Golden State.Why not all 3?Does it hurt your fragile sensibilities is much?He did not carry D WadeWhat's 'carry' mean to you? Also, he wasn't the best player in 06 lmao. He 100% didn't carry Dwade.Koby Brian[deleted]Coby KarlIf Kobe plays basketball and Cobi plays soccer than Koby definitely plays lacrosse[deleted]Ya but he could've easily had another championship or two if he had a good team around him during those years, which is pretty significant. Imagine how different the dialogue about Kobe and comparison to Jordan would be if he had 7 rings. I mean he went to the finals the literal second we got pau gasol [deleted]I'd still take 15 years of 26/12/3 on 58% shooting over 20 years of 25/5/5 on 46% shooting.Haha that's insane to think about what could have been with a Shaq-Duncan twin towers team. I don't know about 10, but if they stuck together, they could've won a bunch. I just can't imagine Duncan without pop and the spurs organization though. They fit so much better together than how Duncan in LA would've been. And do you think Shaq could've handled how good Duncan got even if Duncan agreed to take the secondary role? What if at some point the Lakers decided they wanted to pay Duncan more than Shaq? I bet Shaq would've left.   Definitely agree with what you say at the end. Kobe was just incredible to watch but there were so many times that I'd be yelling "nooo Kobe!" when he'd be putting up stupid shots and missing most. 2004 was so weird though. Getting Payton and Malone after they got defeated by the Duncan Spurs was crazy. Kobe was bad in the finals but so was the rest of the team. I remember being pretty surprised they even made it to the finals. Payton just never seemed to fit into the triangle and Malone was pretty much a liability at that point. And that pistons team was crazy good. They essentially had 5 all-stars and played so well together. Besides Kobe and Shaq, they made that Lakers team look like a bunch of amateurs.FI wish you the best of luck.  On a serious note, if you'll ever be super rich. Don't buy a yacht. Charter it. The upkeep, maintenance and crew expenses are really steep compared to the purchase cost of a yacht. If you'll be using the boat 3/4 of the year, then it might be better to buy. Shaq was such a G. He looked directly at the camera and said "I don't give a shit."I don't even watch sports or keep up with it at all and now I'm in fucking tears.  I feel like I need to get caught up on basketball because I've missed out on so much comedy gold.That's what he said!Boom Tetris for Jeff! Incredible how well that fits Simmons said that his praise of Kimmel in the Shaq roast diary is what got Kimmel's attention and led to him hiring Simmons.Dude you can't just not link usThat was the joke about shaq's bodyguard. the one I saw was the guy looking at shaq's dick in a restroom shaq caught him looking and supposedly said that line.ahh ok thank youI'm surprised most of the audience got it. I would have never figured that one out. Funny af though > J. R. Tolkien-Smith  I can't handle this holy shitFour times only.This summer or in total? Either way it's 0 I betSo goodI'm just waiting for the snek to become Ouroboros Found the Russian agent. Nah people who concern themselves with the political beliefs of others are just almost as insufferable as Warriors fans.For real put some respect on those refs namesSure he did. He completely changed that team and allowed a player like Wade to break out. This isn't a purely points on the scoreboard argument. Shaq changes the way that a team has to defend. Dallas threw a ton of double and even triple teams against Shaq which allowed him to make the smart play, which was pass the ball. DWade punished them mercilessly for that scheme.The disrespect for Shaq is unreal. I realize he's a bit of a mouthpiece and maybe played a few seasons too long, but it's like people don't remember that he was the most dominant force the game had ever seen for nearly a decade. The refs let defenders hammer the guy and he still overpowered them night in night out. Teams had entirely different defensive schemes when they played against Shaq. League rules were changed specifically to address his dominance. DWade was provided an opportunity because of the situation the offense found themselves in due to Shaqs presence on the court.That made me throw upOofThe Pistons.You're out of your fucking mind acting like Gasol was a bad second option  Or if "basketball reasons" and Dwightmare didn't happenDammnit I am old. His statement holds up--pretty much only superteams have won in the last 10 years. Yeah and I truly believed him lolOmg dude basketball imo has been the most meme worthy sport in the last decade You could devote a week just to catch up on the glorious memes of the 2017-2018 season + off season. At the very least catch up on the Colangelo burner account saga and the "he boomed me" memes as well as JR's game one of the finals. This year's Cavs alone could keep you entertained for a long time. "y'all look so different!" Dude do it. I did fantasy basketball a few years ago so I'm a late bloomer myself and I just love the memeverse this sport supports. Just got into basketball last season, and aside from the sport being awesome, the memes and this sub are even better.Hey, Big u/Bumblebee_Tuna!hes so good[removed]I linked it but got removed by auto mod for some reasonWait how old are you? I find it hard to believe most people don‚Äôt know what a [knuckle-dragger](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/knuckle_dragger) refers to.Four times only.So goodD whistleStill salty about that finalsStop guys. Shaq is already dead.D wade more like d ouche Understood. But I don't think that equates to Wade not having an impact on the floor without him.  When I think of carry I think of Westbrook and 2017 or LBJ last year. I'm just saying that I think Wade was a great player maybe not going to the finals great but a great player without Shaq nonethelessShaq won Player of the Week during his first week in the NBA after averaging 25/17 with 4 blocks on 57% shooting. This was 8 years before he won his first ring.   The OG Hack-A-Shaq strategy was already a thing by his second season, because people couldn't figure out how to stop a 21-year old from putting up 29/13 on 60% shooting every night.  In just his third season, he averaged 28/13/6 with 3 blocks on 60% shooting against DPOY Hakeem in the Finals, and this was when he was only 23-years old.  People nowadays pretend like he was a great player for a few seasons while he was with the Lakers and that his years with the Magic and early-Lakers are write-offs, but he legitimately has an argument for being the best center of the 90's, even with David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Patrick Ewing being a thing.You can‚Äôt expect people on here to remember shaq. They‚Äôve only been fans a couple years, cut them some slack. > DWade was provided an opportunity because of the situation the offense found themselves in due to Shaqs presence on the court.  I'm sure the 13ppg Shaq averaged really provided a lot of opportunities since Wade averaged almost 35ppg. Seriously, this is absolutely not disrespect to Shaq, but he 100% did not carry Wade. You could argue that in 2005, his first year in Miami, but Wade was *by far* the better player after that and Shaq's period of dominance was over and he became a journeyman for the rest of his career.The disrespect for Shaq? More like you disrespecting Kobe. Shaq made me an NBA fan, I know how good he was. He was the best player, but he didn't carry Kobe the 2nd and 3rd championship. Go rewatch the series and really take in the work Kobe put in.   Shaq was way past his prime when they won with Dwade, that's not even up for debate.My eYou shush.  Sheed was a monster.  Man could shame a free throw into being missed.[deleted][deleted]I know he‚Äôs not actually going to eat someone but it would probably feel that way. Everything in me would be telling me this man is about to consume me. Overheard at the Classic Tetris World Championship after the match between Jeff and Jonas:  ‚ÄúHe got me,‚Äù Jonas said of Jeff's BOOM! Tetris. "That f***ing Jeff boomed me."  Jonas added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so good,‚Äù repeating it four times.  Jonas then said he wanted to add Jeff to the list of players he goes neck and neck with this summer.x (he‚Äôs so good)^3TY based kitty24 but i'm from the UK and we never use that termFour times only.So goodMade 2011 that much sweeter for ya. Have you seen his shoes? They're huge and I believe he's still wearing them. So he's definitely alive. Wouldn't your last sentence imply shaq carried him to the finals then? Or are you saying they "carried" each other?I talked about this in another comment:  > This isn't a purely points on the scoreboard argument. Shaq changes the way that a team has to defend. Dallas threw a ton of double and even triple teams against Shaq which allowed him to make the smart play, which was pass the ball. DWade punished them mercilessly for that scheme.  Those double/triple teams are why Shaq averaged 13ppg when he was 20 ppg all season. Those double and triple teams are why DWade (and nearly every other 2 guard Shaq played with) had so much success on the wing. Shaq was nearly an automatic 2 points every possession he was under the basket 1-on-1, so opponents had to double team him to give themselves a chance. The trade-off of this strategy leaves space in the mid-range and forces the offense to beat them with perimeter jump shots. That's a much more desirable situation for the defense, as maintaining a consistently high FG% on mid-range or perimeter jump shots is much more difficult.Yeah, I wish the question wasn't in that superstar/sidekick format. Pistons were more of an underdog because they lacked any superstar, therefore they lacked the traditional primary and secondary option setup. For example, you're saying Sheed was the second option (which I'm not saying is wrong) yet Rip and Chauncey had a higher PPG that year and Chauncey, the guy who was second in PPG, won the Finals MVP.Where did you come up with a ten year limit? Shaq's rings that he got the two years prior to that Championship are the original topic here. If there was a time limit, I figured the main topic would probably be included.Look at those Lakers teams, they were pretty putrid outside of Gasol & Bryant.  Prime Gasol was a beast who was playing high level defense, averaging over 10 boards per game, could get you around 20 a game on very few shots, and was legitimately a guy who the offense could run through when the ball was out of Kobe's hands.  Gasol and Kobe were both carrying those teams and he wasn't as flashy a scorer, but he was great despite a lower ppg then most second options.Not even use any seasoning, just raw.  Four times only.  So good (since it's 5x now)I'm saying they both benefited from playing with eachother[deleted]Yeah, I actually struggled to think about who should be classified as the second option.  You could easily make an argument for any of the three being first through third.  In the end I decided that I just wanted to say good things about Sheed.Pistons were an outlier>	Kobe would‚Äôve won more rings if he didn‚Äôt have to play with fucking smush Parker and kwame brown in his prime. Outside of Dirk, Kobe won with the least amount of help in the last decade.  From his original comment[deleted]

Except it featured Nazeem from skyrim and had fertility ads all over itErotic?Link?Put an extra line break between emM- Move in  A- After  C- CompletionYer aff yer heedKim Jong Goons comin for yaI read that in Bill Burr's voiceHe posted that last night, deleted it and said Instagram wouldn‚Äôt let him reupload it, and now he‚Äôs reuploaded it with a rick roll, he‚Äôs too funny Totally thought that's what I was about to see!Would‚Äôve reminded me of this [video](https://youtu.be/n2fV7DqdfI8)...boomed usI had to take a sip this man's a god#YOU KNOW THE RULESNice job with the emojisFound him He's bi. Said it in an interview years ago.We as a society should make Rick Rolling a thing again.By none other than Dennis Rodman. What a world. Don't forget was also married to Carmen Elektra in her prime HOODWINKED, LED ASTRAYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHX0kR58Y1w  Which is an amazing feat in itself. Remember when he was with the Mavericks for 12 games?Pretty sure he's been openly bisexual forever. it was like 2009Maybe, but more like 2008Top ten Dennis Rodman betrayals. I wish I could time travel back to 2006 and make better life decisions/An absolutely disgusting actDude, it's 2019 already. We should be more accepting.Well I for one will never give him up[Not as shocked as I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)This behavior might've been acceptable 8 years ago but it's time to move on people.Especially while combining so many memes of 2007.  Brave indeed.Such strengthThere's so many NBA players you can put in the same basket, even the more unique ones you can always find another player like them but Dennis is truly a one of a kind. Ron Artest/MWP, Lance, Sprewell, etc don't really compare to how strange Rodman is. Dude's an anomaly.He hangs out at a lot of bars and restaurants near me and he‚Äôs known for getting super drunk and not paying his tab. He‚Äôll go expecting people to pay for his drinks since he‚Äôs Dennis Rodman. I mean to be fair he‚Äôs also mentally ill. Not that that should take away anything from himHe‚Äôs also a massive bonehead. Have you ever heard him talk about Kim Jong Un?Dennis Rodman.  Ron "Metta World Peace" Artest.  Stephen Jackson.  Vernon Maxwell.  Rank these 4 in order guys in the range from strange to insane.I don‚Äôt know. He stayed at a hotel I used to work for and I‚Äôve had some strange interactions with him.   One night, he casually walked by one the singers while they were in between sets and asked if he could sing on the mic. He was told no, but he picked up the mic anyway and said ‚ÄúDennis Rodman up in this bitch‚Äù, dropped the mic and walked away like nothing happened.   He also didn‚Äôt sleep, for days on end he had security watching him because he was constantly acting like he was on something. When he left, they found a box in his room with a few dildos in it. No girls were seen going in or out of his room, just him and a couple friends. It's easy to be eccentric when you have millions. I remember Dr. Drew said he had Aspergers back on Celebrity Rehab, or whatever that show was.    For whatever Dr. Drew's reality show diagnosis is worth, I guess.Honestly I appreciate how he‚Äôs so open, everyone‚Äôs a little weird in there own right, now one shares it with other people tho.Nah he‚Äôs actually mentally ill. Weird, also, though https://youtu.be/mHX0kR58Y1w> not mentally ill  Hmmmm, I'm not so sure.A whole other something else of something else.Hey it's me, ur RodmanI. Sent. U. A. PM.I think we found Roger Stone's account. ^The best a man can get>bulls   LMAOOr literally everyone guesses that this dude wouldn't be opposed to fucking anything and anyone. Honestly there's no sexual rumor you can shock me with when it comes to RodmanOr no one gave a fuck> I can‚Äôt believe he*‚Äôs done* this  Yeah sure. That's exactly what Dennis would say to avoid suspicion. I'm onto you Dennis We don't talk.(4x)He's so goodHe's such an interesting character. Best friends with Kim Jong Un and he's [broken his penis three times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3zDKkoNMcg)  EDIT: Dennis I know you're in this thread, I just want u to know ur a legend.  For real. I was sitting there like whats he about to announce? He's got some big project? He's dying of cancer or some other disease?  Oh wait no, him an kim jong are getting married...  Ah fuck i cant believe he's done this.Total unit.What if Sims888 and Dennis Rodman are the same person?Not even a contest. If I was Dray, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be on Reddit lmao.  The name‚Äôs Grindskin... RICK Grindskin. He's probably reading the comments Basketball, on a basketball subreddit? But I'm just here for the memes!If a 35 point triple double is a burp I'd love to see what happens when he vomits.It‚Äôs a great song Deadass will be my wedding songI know most of the lyrics and sing it, passionately, whenever it comes on. This perfectly describes Rodman lolThe most unexpected Rick roll of our day.  Glad I let my phone load it for 7 minutes so I could watch itI knew it was gonna be something like "I was molested, or I'm gay"  But, nope.  Mother fucker. GGBullshit, [it's a cube](http://timecube.2enp.com/).Skyrim was jr. high for you? Fuck me, time is a bitchNo no lolNo I don‚Äôt have it lol it was like in some class and we were learning about html but like it was on a progam not the internet I don‚Äôt have tte thing anymore thoHe painted his nails like a ^(LAY-DEE).Honestly it‚Äôs hilarious to think about how this was made. Either Dennis understands editing software well enough to make this himself, or he hired somebody to make this for himIs that true? If it‚Äôs a philosophical message, I could see the significance of the blank page at the end of the message, and how a rick roll would essentially be the same message. Which is that there‚Äôs nothing he has to tell us, and we‚Äôve essentially wasted our time.That‚Äôs what he posted last night lolHe's so weird.AND SO DO I#A full commitment's what I'm thinking of  #You wouldn't get this from any other guy  #I just want to tell you how I'm feeling  #Gotta make you understand  #Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  #Never gonna run around and desert you  #Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  #Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  #We've known each other for so long  #Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it  #Inside we both know what's been going on  #We know the game and we're gonna play it  #And if you ask me how I'm feeling  #Don't tell me you're too blind to see  #Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  #Never gonna run around and desert you  #Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  #Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  #Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  #Never gonna run around and desert you  #Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  #Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  #(Ooh give you up)  #(Ooh give you up)  #(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)  #(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)  #We've known each other for so long  #Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it  #Inside we both know what's been going on  #We know the game and we're gonna play it  #I just want to tell you how I'm feeling  #Gotta make you understand  #Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  #Never gonna run around and desert you  #Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  #Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  edit: for spacing to read easier.Wtf is the box though?Who?Bet don't go to school tomorrow When I was a kid that always confused the hell out of methat‚Äôs hilarious lmaoStraight to Jail.OK, calm down Joe Buckwhat is this from, I should have asked years agoI'm sorry, but even as a modern millenial, I can't accept this.Although after this video I feel like I've been transported back to 2008. But will you let him down? What a year. Not anomaly, he's an alienHe was the only person who was wierder than eric andre on the eric andre show and it felt like they were the guests on the dennis rodman show lmfaoHe was also pretty much the first really *weird* player at that level in the NBA. I can't off the top of my head think of other players that were really out there. The ones you've named all came well after.Ron Artest was a really nice and genuine guy when he played in Indiana. He used to come to my moms work and would bring my brother and I random Pacers merch all the time and spent so much money on flowers for his wife. 1. Oxygen deprivation can cause brain damage.  2. There's less oxygen higher up in the air.  3. NBA athletes are taller than the average population.  4. Therefore, they get less oxygen and are more likely to suffer brain damage.He use to drink at the Hard Rock casino all the time by himself.  I would see him there early sometimes.  It was a very public bar, open and connected to the casino floor.  He wanted to be noticed, it was kinda sad.  Edit: IN Hollywood, FL 10+ years agoI got confused and thought you were responding to the person asking why Stephen Jackson would be considered weird. I also wondered, and thought you nailed the answer.Holy shit do you live near the OC? I saw him do this exact act at a sushi restaurant once. Mind you, this was at a very low-key restaurant, but he kept making the rounds between every table while being obnoxiously drunk and loud. Tried to convince a table to pay for him even after stealing some of their sushi. The guy‚Äôs an asshole.Aye class of 47‚ÄôIn south county?Yeah he's a real dick. Very often in Newportis that like your armchair phd diagnosis, or is he actually mentally ill?I've heard him blame the people Kim Jong Un kidnaps and tortures for exactly what Jong Un accused them of.  On CNN. can you give me the scoop on stephen jackson and vernon maxwell? as a laker fan im definitely very aware of MWP's ..history...lolyou forgot lance [deleted]One art, please!If it was really Dennis   He. Would. Be. Typing. Like. This. üëçPlot twist, he's actually Kawhi's uncleDennis, you're the greatest of all time rebounding machine and fashion-forward bombshell--I wanna be you, but only you can be you!  If this is actually Scottie, your voice deep man--what gives?  If this a random redditor, get my message to Dennis or be cursed to be forever disappointed by the sandwiches you eat until you die.He then said he wants to add Rick Astley to the list of artists he wants to block on SpotifyHe's so goodI was hoping that link was the animated interview Viceland did for Party Legends.How can you break your dick three times and not have pain for the rest of your lifenot available in my country ;( Have any of us seen them in the same room?I guess I'm just dumb I don't know how people are able to respond with their name and then put John Stockton or Draymond Green after Wait, I thought this was a homo erotica sub? Right? All that shit is classic, Take on Me, anything by the cure/depechemode/talking heads/anything weirdly poppy/electronic  Everyone wants to rock with the 80's but booms the musicI had an online girlfriend and I asked her about that song and she sent it to me. She was the one. She rick-rolled me. That's how you know it's real. I miss her.The video has that 80's booty shakin'Implying anybody on this sub will ever get marriedDon't sleep on "Together Forever"Jesus man 7 minutes? I'm on mobile, and this site looks like one big rant. Did it go any further into what time cube means? Or what that marshmallow thing is? Fuck that. The truth is at r/cylinderearth Oh no not againI was almost 9 when Skyrim was releasedthats EXACTLY what somebody would say if he didTime to write a sequel.Defintly got someone else to do it, Dennis is too busy commenting blanks on every basketball related post dennisThe Hulk Hogan Impersonation.Dennis Rodman isn't for jail.We have the best patients in the world. Because of jail.You undercook fish, straight to jail. You overcook chicken, straight to jail. Undercook, overcook. We have the best rebounders...because of jail *PyongyangYou rick roll, believe it or not, jail.Overcook, undercook ... straight to jailStraight to North Korea detention camp !Randy Moss pretending to moon the crowd after scoring a TD vs the Packers, and Joe Buck losing his shit  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5dmqGg6Ccvw I accept your disapproval.Maybe you need to take a long look in the mirror and accept yourself, and then you'll find that room in your heart for Dennis.Will he ever run around and desert him?That's what I thought he was finally going to admit in this video!It's even been confirmed!  https://youtu.be/AJOVUF-HaDw?t=18Not much of a disguiseFrom Solaxiant 9 specificallySam Cassell is [an alien.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w5h33nI9v3Y/TpOr0ZJ9CvI/AAAAAAAADE8/VIb70PUV1V8/s320/sam-cassel-et-look-alike-nba-funny-photos.jpg)I just looked it up and that was really weird watching the roles reversed on who makes who uncomfortable. I like how he immediately segued from that bizarre "they ain't got no North Korea" comment to "have you ever had sex with somebody that's asleep" and it didn't even phase Rodman.Mans started eating candy off the grimy carpet floor lmaoBill Walton was and is pretty fucking weird. Awesomely weird, but weird. Know what else is weird? The word weird.He's also way fucking weirder than any of them. He's so weird that I actually respect it. I think Ron Artest may be your father. I mean he almost committed suicide with a shotgun in a team parking lot, was the son of a single mother in an abusive household with like 15 other kids, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs admitted to being bipolar so take that for data This is the guy that supports N Korea right? If he‚Äôs mentally sane then he would just be evil. i mean he‚Äôs Dennis Rodman, he‚Äôs definitely mentally ill. it‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt let it bother you, we all accept himMy favorite is when people ask him how he can be friends with a tyrannical murderer and he's just like, "Man, I don't know nothing about that. All I know is we ate sushi and he took me skiing and he was a really nice dude."Yeah I thought Stephen Jackson was just hood as fuck and likes to throw handsOnly in my nightmaresExactly get these fake Dennis‚Äô outta here You mean like this ‚Äú      ‚ÄúCan anyone get a message to Dennis Rodman? Even if I was face-to-face with him, I don't know if it would go through. He's on another level.This was the most unexpected Rick Roll of all timeHe's so goodYou're right, that one's a lot better. I'll put that instead! Be Dennis fucking Rodman Can‚Äôt feel pain if you‚Äôre high as a kite 24/7...I‚Äôm guessing that man is on another planet at most times I‚Äôve never seen Rodman in the same room as me...am I Dennis Rodman?? I'm sorry we told you the truth, it must've been amazing to think you were talking to Draymond, Stockton, Curry, LeBron and etc... all the timeDude don't worry. We really out here. I'm  LaMoodles AldroodlesIt‚Äôs called a flair - look at the settings on the sidebar of r/nba (if you‚Äôre on a PC) and you can set it to be any player or just a team![deleted]Bro ‚ÄúBurning down the house‚Äù is my energy jam on mornings where I‚Äôm just not feeling it.

Got damnYikesTime to write a SQL. Get it? Programming joke? No?he does it on meme pages too, hes evolvingWhat's his igSmith Jr? Schr√∂der? Villenueve? Well, duh. His name isn't Dennis *Jail*man.He's not locked in there with them, they are locked in there with himIf Ambassador Rodman continues to behave in this fashion, the slammer is the only viable option. Sad!You miss a layup? Jail. You hit the 3? Believe it or not, jail./r/UnexpectedPawneeWow, wtf is wrong with that guy? Mooning ppl like that, this is a disgusting act! you know what is a discusting act joe buck? you broadcasting games even though you know shit about football. thanks for ruining every game ever.Hahaha this is great. Didn't notice it back then.I never noticed before but what the hell is J wearing in that clip? Hes got no tie and some weird priest like shirt on or something.Literally the same quote said in mib about him lol*fazeSeeing both Hannibal and Andre just shocked was amazing Bill Walton is "hippy weird" and back in the day there was a lot of people the same. Rodman is his own brand of weird.You know what's even more weird than the word weird? Words.I‚Äôd be ok with thatHe also married himself while wearing a gown. LmaoHe was also on that show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew and opened up about a lot of stuff, I can't remember examples now because it was like 10 years ago but I do remember thinking "damn, this dude is legit crazy."yeah, that's a pretty fair assessment, damnCan we not talk about acknowledging mental illness as "admitting" something please?  That implies that mental illness is something people should feel guilty of, which isn't exactly helpful.Plus isn't he best buds with a murderous dictator?Yeah, these are two totally different things, in my opinion. Like MWP is exponentially weirder than Jackson, and Rodman is exponentially weirder than MWP.Are we talking about corner rams running back Stephen Jackson?Honestly, I'm still in shambles. I've been bamboozled.this actually made my Monday morning, I was ready for the whole videoHe's so goodI wonder if it‚Äôs a metal Rod, man100% yes. Damn, I ruined it didn‚Äôt I... 18 Naked basketball players in the showers of r/nbaPaul Ryan's too.the Talking Heads had some great songs.I don‚Äôt think Rick Astley falls into New Wave, just pop imo. If he is new wave he‚Äôd probably be one of the worst new wave artists for sure, there‚Äôs just so many better artists/songsthanks pops.Tears For Fears are fucking awesome. *Songs From The Big Chair* is literally just hit after hit.Head over heels my dudeEnjoy the (non) silence. Did you post that from your desktop computer with your AOL free trial cd?   we both want to die. I was 25.  That was only 7 years ago. YesVillenueve's name is Denis. (Pronounced like denny, not like penis)Yeah. We shouldn't have to spare the rod with his punishment then.> there...their  Come on man.You win game by too little? Jail. You win game by too much? Also jail.We have the best players in the world because of jail.He later clarified that he thought that Moss had actually mooned the crowdI honestly don't have a problem with him, but I will say the highlight of his career was when, sadly, ~~Josh~~ David Freese hit that walkoff homer in game 6, and Joe got to quote his father "And we'll see you tomorrow night..."  PS- Fuck Nelly Cruz!Let him keep doing football if it will get him away from baseball. He's so disinterested he brings shame to the legacy of his father. He is the Play by Play guy Aikman is the color guy who is supposed to know about the game. https://youtu.be/fkCSZKbyL94I'm a little pissed that you're even suggesting the national treasure Bill Walton is like anyone else.Eminem‚Äôs beard?that‚Äôs more cool than anythingthere's also the whole being friends with a mass murderer thingBro, i did just smoke, but I thought he was about to come out the closet or some shit like that lol  Hoodwinked, led astray Heckin bamboozleIt's already at 4x so I won't be a homerYou did dray, ruined this dude excitement like it was an nba player's ballsack I hope that‚Äôs political humor and not a fact.Some? Their entire Discography is fantastic. David Byrne is a genius.I agree. But the other things mentioned are definitely New WaveExactly. I cringed a little hearing him in the same breath as Depeche Mode, the Cure, and Talking Heads. Comparing a one hit wonder to all time great smhwhy don't you call your mother more?Remember chat rooms?I was 25... once.  Def not 7 years ago, though. Morrowind was released when I was 25.And I believe in cinema[MRW I learned that my bestest friend has something to tell me.](https://i0.heartyhosting.com/radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/north-korean-dictator-kim-jong-un-korean-spies-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C400&ssl=1)Too little, too much.I think it was David FreeseYeah, it's orange and nothing rhymes with orange...Real talk can I marry myself?I mean, if there was a megalomaniac that has enslaved his own people, killed his own brother in a public and brutal hit, and has nukes, would you want to upset him by declining his invitation to his birthday party? You mean Trump or Kim?He knew people would assume he was coming out as gay or transgender or something. He played us for our preconceived notions. Played us like *fools*. Kicked him *right in the innocence.*It‚Äôs humor but what is a fact is that Paul Ryan‚Äôs favorite band is rage against the machine. Humour... I certainly hope it's not a fact.Stop Making Sense is one of the best records ever created studio or not.It‚Äôs an insult to David Byrne to be compared to Rick AstleyIt got awkward after I broke both of my arms.A/S/L?I was 16, and based on these comments I‚Äôve read, most of the folks around us were conceptual.   That‚Äôs an exaggeration but only slightly. https://i.imgur.com/5oycP0z.jpgI‚Äôm not licensed and not a preacher.. but i‚Äôll allow it, for a small fee of course [deleted]i think there are a few steps before you enter the bday circle, like visiting and snorting a ton of coke off some malnourished slaves balding scalpI mean, he apparently invited MJ over first and was turned down. Uh... yeah.  Don't go to North Korea.  By befriending Kim Jung Un and campaigning for him as this "good dude", all that does is normalize him to the rest of the world, despite the fact that KJU is in fact a mass murdering dictator.  Unfortunately, there are some people in today's world that now think that Kim Jung Un isn't as bad anymore, and I do believe that Rodman aided in that shift of mentality.  Dennis Rodman is a funny dude and absolute legend on the floor, but I 100% do not support what he has done with North Korea.also one of Rage Against the Machine's least favorite people is Paul Ryan   The ^more^you^knowwhaaaaaaaaaaa....13/M/(midwestern state) That's why you always get a prenup Who you think gets better coke? Rodman or Kim?Lol when he said that, one of the members (can‚Äôt remember who- Morello, maybe?) came out and said that he was the machine they were raging against lmfaohe listens to them ironically
r/nba,KD joined GSW after blowing a 3-1 lead to them in the West Finals.   LeBron joined the Lakers after they won the Summer League title.  What's with the double standard?  You fuckin boomed usBoi I came in ready for war, got me goodAt least KD joined a team of nobodies. Bron is joining lonzo and mcgeeI was going to say, ‚Äúdelete this nephew,‚Äù until I opened it up...Now the nephew has become the uncle OP you probably are getting downvoted on sight based on title + flair, but that was pretty funny.Y'all joke, but Suns planning on playing Bridges/Jackson/Bender/Ayton Kings playing Fox/Jackson/Bagley/Mason3/Giles. This is going to be a fun ass SL. First game is tomorrow at 7ET on ESPN3 if anyone cares   edit: No Gary For a moment I thought this was posted by a KD burner account... Then I read the post.Looks like nobody actually read the post lolPeople not realizing this is a joke. Shows how on edge everyone is lol.Quality shitpostLAKERS RUINED THE NBA.  I‚ÄôM NOT EVEN GOING TO WATCH THE SUMMER LEAGUE.  JUST GIVE THE LAKERS THE TROPHY ALREADY. If I could upvote this 73 times I would. ITT: People saying how nobody read the post when most everybody read the post.I mean, the last time the Cavs and Lakers played the Lakers blew out the Cavs.  http://www.nba.com/games/20180311/CLELAL  HE JUST JOINED THE TEAM WHO BLEW HIM OUT. GRAB THE PITCHFORKS!!!!!https://imgur.com/gallery/AqsR0i7Whew. I'm glad this was a shit post. For a second I was tilted.The real double standard is that Korver is now reverted back to thinking "Man, this guy (Lebron) gets all the calls." As someone who doesn't follow basketball, but knows that both of these players are good and that Lebron has been in the media for leaving the Cavs, I don't understand the joke here. Can someone explain please?Everyone in this thread "WOOOSH"God damn it you got me.I was ready to murdalize you...Ya got me you beautiful bastard.It's arguably worse op. This will be fun to follow just to see how many people don't even read the actual post.The joke is flying over a lot of heads in hereI was triggered for .5 secs then immediately realized it had to be a joke. I would like to thank OP, for this post, it proves without a doubt, that so many people within this sub and the NBA community in general simply don't read and react blindly based of their initial reaction.  I've never seen so many contenders for r/woooosh, in one comment section in my life.With the first ever unanimous summer league mvp no lessThis shitpost goes to show you how many people don't read before typing.I upvoted you!Summer League > blowing a 3-1 lead.  QuickTime maths.Man, if anything my respect for Bron just went up levels. He is committed to 4 years, trusting Magic, and not holding us hostage with 1+1's trying to play GM. He did what I've been dogging him for his whole career, which is coming to the bloodbath that is the west. Not only that, he was the first one and didn't even care about pussy boi Paul George! Truly a big baller he is..I think I speak for all of us when I say: We just got bamboozled.Did anyone else almost fall for this? Gee whiz, I almost did. I read the title and was like, ‚Äúman, you gotsta be kidding me‚Äù and THEN I read further and OP WAS KIDDING!  What a roller coaster. What about you? Did anyone else think OP was serious only to find out OP was just playing?How many people here vote on threads before reading them?I was about to go off, thankfully I read the whole post. Uncle-tier shitpostOpened this thread like ‚Äúis this fool really tryna...‚Äù   Leaving thisnthread like ‚Äúfine. you got me.‚Äù 10/10 setup and execution. theres nothing left for lebron at cavs. I think its awesome he joined the lakersGot Eemlol KD and GSW fans going around downvoting every sensible comment on herequality shitpostQuality shitpostLOL... this is goodLets be honest, of the two, the summer league is the more relevant championshipKD needs to tweet this.No upvote is enough for this.Plot Twist: OP wasn't joking.Hahahhhaah man I was coming into here to start swinging. Some of yall aren't reading the second sentence. I came in expecting to have to explain for the millionth time how it's different but it's pretty obvious he's joking.Holy fuck y'all are dense mother fuckers.Because... ohhhhhhh nice this post dumb AF  dumb comparison  if lakers were/is at any level of GSW then it'd be different.   the upvotes too sheeesh  edit***  fuck I took the bait i need to learn how to readLeBron going for that summer league title. I‚Äôm truly amazed by people‚Äôs complete inability to instantly realize when something is obviously a joke/sarcasm/shitpost. almost downvoted but then i read the body[Everyone in this thread](https://giphy.com/gifs/funny-nba-basketball-1rKFUO2pf4pfgE9hnV)LeBron  James just lost 4 out of 5 of the last NBA Finals series. He should get criticized for doing something to protect his legacy like KD was trying to do.OKC Thunder fans felt betrayed while Cavaliers fans were grateful to Lebron. Essentially Lebron did everything he could and left a championship behind while the KD didn't leave the thunder with a championshipThis joke was so obvious how does it have 30k upvotes Durant is a pussy tho.You got an out loud chuckle from me. That‚Äôs about the highest praise I can give on reddit. LiAngelo joining after Summer League as Bron's Powerade boy.    edit: u/NefariousNeezy correctionAnd he isn't even the only multi-MVP who went to the Lakers.Ya got me. Top Quality ShitpostYou *almost* got me with the shitpost.  Almost.This is hiw you get the best out of Reddit. Top top qualityKD took a paycut to join the best team in the league and take a back seat. LeBron took a full salary to join a lottery team and be the focal point. holy fuckin shit, this guy fucksLMAOKd joined a team who could win without him. Weak ass move from someone of his caliber, and also in his prime. To be "respected" he needed to either A stay and win with thunder, or B go on to a different team that has close to nothing or hasn't found the right pieces yet and build from there. LeBron is going to a worse than par Lakers team and not only basically gets to play GM there, but he will be doing something no one has done in quite a few years and that's bring the Lakers back to greatness I'm from r/all and out of the loop. Can someone explain the joke for me?I'm here from /r/all. I don't get it, what's the joke?because the lakers are kinda shit rn tbh. building a team is respected Can we force the angry people answering this seriously to wear a dunce flair for a week?Straight outta Caloocan!This shit is too funny. Quality shitpost that has riled up the Lebron haters. Several reasons, but mostly it has to do with LeBron going to join a really bad team and KD going to a dynasty team...Shitpost of the yearI was about to go off but well played famBecause he carried his team If OP had Warriors flair, I would assume he was being serious.Was ready to berate you for being a god damn moron, ya done bamboozled me. Does nobody read the full post? Ok what don‚Äôt you understand here?  Lebron‚Äôs road = easy  KD‚Äôs road = hard (possibly hardest)I've said it before, I'll say it again: if LeBron wants to win all the time, he should join the Globetrotters. You were about to have these blog bois HEATED[deleted]LBJ got Cleveland a championship Big difference is LeBron is teaming up with legendary dudes like Lonzo and Julius.  KD had some scrubs named Klay and Steph.Came in ready to unleash some wisdom, no need.hahahahhahahaahahaahahahahhaahhahahahaa i am a Laker fan but this shit funnyThat shit was good, lol. OP making my blood pressure go up for no reasonlakers is a garbage team that's why, he better hope kawhi join him. He can go and fuck himself for joining that shit team!For those actually trying respond to this thread, here‚Äôs a collective r/wooooshOP knows how to shit post. Because KD joined a stacked team that just eliminated his team from the playoffs.  While LeBron is going to one of the weaker teams of the West and trying to build something off young talent.  Because he's not joining a 73 win team?ITT: Ppl who are trolled.  YEA WELL FUCK YOU GUY WHAT DO YOU KNOW   just kidding but this post actually made me bust out laughing, good one man.JahahahahahahahGood one Too many people riled up to enjoy a nice shitpostCus LeBron is joining a young lakers team who won 30+ games last season. KD joined an already winning team :)) Lebron came back and won a championship for Cleveland Kd joined a contender, LBJ joined a rebuild.  Edit: Just re read the post.. you got me good.Shitposters take notes.  This is how you do it.What's the difference between the Lakers and Warriors? About 38 wins, 3 All-NBA players, and two vehicles.I've been wondering the same thing since the Heatles move. Everyone has been on his dick his whole career because everyone wants another Jordan.KD joined an already great team lead by Curry, with it already being a contender as is.   LeBron is joining a mediocre team lead by no one, that had no contention hopes in sight. You joke, but how many all time greats have jumped ship as many times as LeBron when things weren't looking good for the team?Because ~~Durant is a fucking asshole who joined a stacked-prime team in his prime and he plays in a piece of shit city who rooted for Houston in the World Series alongside Cubs fans~~ OH, I GET IT NOW.i lol'd  bigwoosh for these nephewsOP fuckin boomed all these nephews.LOL, funny shitpost but risky title.  I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt get deleted or downvoted upon submissionBro, you had me tilted before I clickedBecause lebron is the best player in the league and the cavs are fucking shite?Well, LeBron was not up 3-1 in the conference finals against the Lakers after LA won 73 games the season before joining a team with 3 All-Stars. I was revving up my list of stats and preparing my eyes for insults from the GS Filipino ArmadaThis is the lamest post to be at the top and get gold. Losing faith in this sub. KD joined a team that went 73-9 without him, which indicated an easy way to win a ‚Äòship. LeBron joins a 35-47 team without any all-stars (at the moment) that didn‚Äôt make the playoffs, willing to build and grow a championship contending team rather than just joining an established one.perfect shitpostlol I was about to come in here and call you an idiot based of the title only but I chuckledHahahaAnother quality shitpost.You ducking boomed meI, for one, look forward to the end of the Ball family era.This is the comedy I was hoping for when the news broke.Not gonna lie, I came in ready to tell OP to delete. I've been had.ughUghSummer League champs with the Summer League MVP on there team. Quite honestly sad to what sports have become Kawhi is most likely going to go to the Lakers and they probably expected Paul George. So it could've been a super team and possibly will be.Because he brought a championship to a city that wouldn't get one otherwise.As i read the title: come on, are u serious? As i read the post: thanks for the good laugh got click baited smhI came here armed with a pitchfork only to read the post and put it away. Well played, OP.Because Russell Westbrook. There is no double standard. Everyone who bounces to another team first time around will be criticized. After that, no one gives a shit. ilyLiterally ruined the NBA. /sOh man I didn‚Äôt know why this was upvotes at first. Hilarious.I got so mad before I read the lost lmao Actually, LeBron took a boatload of crap when he signed with Miami. Honestly I immediately came here to downvote and criticise you because of the title. But hot damn that was hilarious. Between Javale, Lonzo, Kuzma and Lance they have 4 players who could make 1st team all troll honors this year.  Can you say Dy-nasty?I read the thread title, and was about to make a smart remark about how a lot of ppl probably already made smart remarks, but then I read the op and realized you were kidding.  Thank god.  Keep r/nba troll free!Well played hahahahGreat post.People giving LeBron a sympathy pass because you know he‚Äôs going to get a LaVar Ball lecture about how the Lakers are STILL his son LOnzo‚Äôs team and yes that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre going to print his son‚Äôs name now so the ‚Äúmedia doesn‚Äôt mix up LOnzo with LeBron‚Äù?Lakers have summer league mvp AND summer league title mvpI was armed and ready coming into this post... Don't let this distract you from the fact that the city of Cleveland is Lebron's side hoeBuried the lead a little too deepLebron, Ingram, Lonzo, Randle, KCP, Lance, Kuzma and Hart win 52-54 games.KD May have gone to the GSW, but THEY were the ones who said yes.You sly son of a gun you...There is only one Overlord UberSnek. bruh lolLebron joins a champion KD joined the losers  If we were talking fairly, Bron deserves more criticism.Fucking need a sidebar link for all the memes in this sub. Casuals like me can't keep up. hahaha I was bout to go in but then I read the second sentence LMAO[You, you....](https://youtu.be/218iXiKhKlg)smh Lebron knows he‚Äôll never be better than MJ so he‚Äôs trying to one-up Kobelol i had like things to spout some shit but good one."He's so good, He's so good" we replied 4 timesgod damn it i love the boomed us meme so muchHe's so good*That /u/NefariousNeezy f*****g boomed us...* I need to add NefariousNeezy to the list of trolls I need to see less this summer. Lmao i love you. This was hilariousWhy isn't this post receiving the same criticism Kevin Durant got for joining the warriors?If I understood any of the letters in the title I might get this. I had the same thought. Cracked my knuckles for nothing.Fuck man same. Now I‚Äôm all hyped up and angry about a bamboozle.   Anyone want to fight about dumb stuff still? Like honeydew or some shithe fucking boomed you*My fingers were readyI don't even have a dog in this fight and I still came in a little fired up.  About that dog though: seriously.  He's dead.  The league killed him in 2008.  Fuck all of you.Uhh, correction. LeBron joined Lonzo and Moritz Wagner. McGee is just a bandwagon hopper.Oh, you mean back-to-back NBA champion JaVale McGee?  Tables have turnt, now!  Gonna be a Lakers/Celtics Finals and I got Lakers in 3.Ridiculous super team. I‚Äôm not even going to watch nba next season cause we already know Lakers are going to win the championship. And Lance! Lance make 'em dance#JAVAAAAALE MCGEEDon‚Äôt forget Kuz! And Lonzo is hurt this season. There‚Äôs nothing there this year. He‚Äôs just waiting for Kwai and that still won‚Äôt be close to enoughLeBron teaming up with NBA Legend Lavar Ball. KD had to settle for some nobody like Steve Kerr.And fucking Lance.  Utter bullshit. Why even have a season, just skip straight to 1:27 left in 2nd Q of game 3 in the conf finals.And Paul George and likely Kawhi.KD joined Eztshp and Xalyk. You know, Nobodies.Oh how the turntables>Now the nephew has become the uncle   /r/unexpectedpoetry What a storyline, like the plot of a movieKawhi's uncle?

Now I am the uncle.The rare "delete this uncle" sarcasm shitpostNot gonna lie, my reaction was "This dude is high af"[deleted]I angry-clicked so hard, ready to foam at the mouth and totally confused as to why it was upvoted so hard.  Fell for it.guilty. I downvoted initially based on title, until I read your comment. Then read the text and changed to an upvote.I was about to go in until I saw the Summer League part. This was well played. Our playoffsTrent Jr. was trade to usThe league made Lonzo retire from Summer League. Too good. Now other teams have a chance End score? 83-76Damn they really plan on playing Jackson and Fox? I thought they proved themselves this past yearNgl I downvoted before opening itThats reddit for you. Its like the number 1 rule. Some people probably don't even read the threads. They just base it off of the title and vote.Sorry but I‚Äôm ignorant; could someone please explain the joke? I don‚Äôt watch basketball. However,I know who KD and Lebron are, but that‚Äôs about it. Say 'KD' again! I dare you! üò≠üò≠üò≠Bronsexuals ready to downvote anythingtbf the post isn‚Äôt that funny. It pales in comparison to the shitpost quality I‚Äôm normally spoiled with hereI swear. Someone need to run for office cause of these shitposts my dudes.Ahhh missed being back on top and being hated!73 upvotes but no gold?Best I can do is 9.73 üòÇI'm just trying to find all the posts that seem to have fell for it and can't..A few years ago, Kevin Durant (playing for the Thunder) lost to the Warriors in the final four of the NBA playoffs. It was a tough loss because he was extremely close to the finals. The Warriors team that he lost to also had the most regular season wins in league history, though they ended up losing the championship. Durant left the Thunder for the Warriors that off-season, which resulted in an /r/nba riot of sorts; it was seen as a "real bitch move" to join a super team. In a way, the decision to join the Warriors was seen as an admission that Durant could never beat them so he had to join them.  The joke in this thread is that LeBron's Lakers situation is similar. OP tricked people into believing that he was serious until the body text was read. The Lakers have been bad for awhile now, so the idea that they're similar to the Warriors is ludacris. The summer league competitions are really for testing new talent, no one cares about winning it as a measure of team dominance. The closest thing I can think to compare it to is bragging about doing well on a class's pretest when you ended up getting a D in the class.  Another note, people are on edge because one of LeBron's previous moves to the Heat has been compared to this. That situation is a lot murkier - some would tell you it's similar to or worse than Durant to the Warriors, but I wouldn't be one of them. Either way, there's an expectation that nephews (the /r/nba version of youtube commenters) are going to start making these comparisons so people are ready to get on the defensive.Hey what was that? r/wooooshfucking boomed youSup ya beautiful bastards hope you're having a fantastic Monday. Nothing arguable about it, as Golden State didn't even win the championship in 2016.How many trophies do the Warriors have? How many do the Lakers have? Real bitch move by Lebron there. Just want free ridesSort by controversial for the interesting onesPost is 10h old and the jig is still not up. It's incredibly hilarious and sad. It's 3 sentences. I hid the joke in the middle and a lot of folks still didn't see it.I wanted to do a sarcastic bait and switch shitpost.  It ended up becoming a social experiment. Both hilarious and sad. 3 sentences. I hid the joke between 2 sentences and it might as well not be there.Dont wear that saddle out just yet, plenty of time to get settled inA lot. Now we know.Respect for admitting. Some are doubling down.I saw a post on Facebook that was the Lakers' top 10 players of all time and it had like Lonzo Ball, Marcelo Huertas, and a bunch of other random crappy players and the comments were full of "WHERE IS MAGIC? WHERE IS KAREEM? THIS IS SUCH A TERRIBLE LIST! THIS PERSON KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE LAKERS"Many /r/woooosh in this house.Uhh, LeBron endorses Powerade.javale is a goat lebron is still chasing himLOL I am getting angry messages and/or paragraphs upon paragraphs as to why Im'm stupid.

Had to turn that vote upside-down. People caring too much about upvotes and downvotes[deleted]A couple years ago in 2016, Kevin Durant's team (Oklahoma City) went ahead 3 games to 1 in a playoff series against the Golden State Warriors. The Golden State team had achieved a 73-9 record in the regular season that year, a record, so it was a big deal for them to almost lose. Well, Golden State came back to win the series 4-3, spawning a load of 3-1 comeback memes.   A few months later, KD signed on with the Golden State Warriors in the offseason (where we are now this year). He's gotten a LOT of flak for this choice, because it looks kinda like a bitch move to join not only the team that you just lost to in embarrassing fashion, but one of the historically greatest teams of all time with that 73-9 record. KD may be the 2nd best basketball player in the world, so for him to join the already overpowered Warriors definitely upset the balance of the NBA.  LeBron just joined the Lakers, who have been pretty bad for the past 5 years or so. OP's joke has to do with the fact that about a year ago, the Lakers' Summer League team won the championship. The Summer League is mostly used by teams to test out players who may or may not even make their roster once the regular season starts- rookie draftees, players with little NBA stock and experience, and undrafted players mostly. Next to no conclusions of consequence can be drawn from Summer league results aside from "this player is NBA ready", basically.   So the joke is that OP is sarcastically making a false equivalency between KD joining one of the greatest teams of all time who had already won a championship, and LeBron joining a team whose Summer League squad won that championship, when the Summer League championship actually counts for almost nothing.OP set us up to think she/he was going to equate jumping on to the Lakers (34 wins, no rings on roster) to jumping into GSW (73 wins, a title 13 months prior). Plot twist: it was a joke pretending that summer league titles are a mark of greatness.I wouldn't be surprised also if some of the upvotes come from people who didn't click into the thread and seriously thinks this is a good argument against LeBron.I believe proper nomenclature is ‚ÄúLeBronies‚Äù.

I'm a simple man, I see a recounting of KD being a bitch and I upvoteDamn I need you around to explain things. What a  precise and efficient explanation.So the Lakers are not the same caliber as the GSW and such a comparison is laughable.

Dirk next.This is truly the end of one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history.Absolute legend. 1st ballot easyFuck, I‚Äôm not even a Spurs fan but I‚Äôm tearing up.This is Kawhi's faultGINNNOBLIIIIIIHoly shit Plz be a fake one plz be a fake one plz be a fake one  *opens link*   NoGame 4 against the warriors was a great sendoff for the spurs fans at leastAs a Spurs fan from San Antonio, I always loved Manu the most. They say youre not supposed to meet your heroes, but I know if I met Manu i wouldn't be the least bit disappointed. He will always be my favorite athlete. This is so sad. Alexa tek de plejEnd of an era. Legend.props to him on an amazing career, spurs about to be looking super different Good night, sweet prince. üò¢For years when I was a child, my older brother refused to play with me unless it was basketball. So we played. Would block the hell out of me and steal the ball every single time. He was bigger, five years older, and I hated every single second of it. Hated basketball for years because of this.  And then, on random chance, I saw a video of Manu Ginobili doing something ridiculous on the court. He was so different from what I'd known basketball to be that I fell in love instantly. His weird herky-jerky playstyle and impossible passes were like magic unfolding before my eyes. Before I knew it, I was following the Spurs religiously and the rest of the NBA like it was something I'd been missing all my life.  Thank you for everything, Manu. You've made the impossible happen so many times that I can't even begin to point to a favorite highlight. Your attitude, your candor, your passion --- what a player and, more importantly, what a human being you are. But my favorite thing about you is how you kept getting up every single time you fell, how you kept trying some impossible shot or pass no matter how spectacularly you failed before. You are inspiring.  I wish you all the best for whatever comes next!FHoly fuck, the Big 3 has officially come to an end in what‚Äôs the most depressing offseason for Spurs fans. Thank you, Manu...for everything.   Looks like Derrick White is gonna be thrown into the fire real damn quick. We went quietly into that good night.The end of the biggest dynasty the NBA has seenThis man defeated my heat  But he smiled at me when I saw him in a restaurant  The NBA will miss him Lost Manu, Parker and Kawhi all in the same off-season, damnNOOOOO MANU WHYThank you for putting your heart and soul into this game, Manu. Shout out to the best 6th man ever. THANK YOU!#NOMASEuro stepping his way into the Hall of fame, much love from a Miami Heat fanNoooWow, a career that will never be forgotten. What an amazing career. Sad day to be a spurs fan. One of my favorite non-Sixers players in recent memory. Can't wait until his Hall moment.Man I was not ready for this. My favorite player since I first started watching basketball seriously in 2003.   Thanks for everything.Derozan, Aldridge, and Murray's Spurs.  &#x200B;  That sounds weird.

I absolutely loved his crafty passes.   Man, I'm not ready for all these dudes I grew up watching to leave.I‚Äôm not crying, you are crying Absolute rough year for a loyal spurs fan. Much love Manu! Thanks for all the years, we'll see you soon at your jersey retirement!Man I just simulated a 2k18 season yesterday and he was my 6th man and we won the ship. Kyrie, Wiggins, Crabbe, Blake Griffin and Serge, with Manu as sixth man. Sad times...One of the most unique players in NBA history. All is left is Dirk and Vince. This kills Spurs fans..People don‚Äôt realize it, but Manu was the inspiration for a lot of young guards in the game. Harden and Deangelo Russell come to mind. Manu gave a lot to the game of basketball, and will be missed.GINOBILI!!!!!!  &#x200B;  Nothing but respect from a Mavs fan. Tek da pledj!  Congratulations Manu!The only people left from the 2014 title team are Mills and Belinelli iirc.   First ballot, NBA legend, imma miss you Manu:(It‚Äôs so surreal to see people like him retiring. He‚Äôs been such a mainstay as long as I‚Äôve watched the NBA and not having him play will be crazy Spurs really not gonna be the same OMG. Worst summer ever.    One of my favorite players growing up. Have fun euro-stepping into retirement my Argentine brethren Thank you everything Manu! There will never be another quite like him. The skill, the hard work, the unselfishness. He, along with Dirk, paved the way for a lot of the guys playing today. An innovator, a treasure to Spurs fans, the NBA, and the country of Argentina. Should be a first ballot HOFerOne of the greatest international players, if not, the best. He's a first ballot lock for HOF no doubt. I'm a Bulls fan, but during our rebuilding phase I always rooted for the Spurs every playoff run. The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili trio will always be one of my favorites of all time. Ginobili is such a clutch and crafty player. You'll be one of my favorite players ever Manu. One of the reasons why I'm a spurs fan. Enjoy retirment mate!GINOBILIIIIIIIIIIIY'all talk about his game and it was fantastic, but y'all sleeping on the fact that manu once had [great hair](http://intotheopenfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/53050260.png)Like my friend from Argentina used to say: Michael Jordan was the Manu Ginobili of Americans. üò¢WTFFFFRIP Manu you will be missedSad that he‚Äôs not gonna get one last great big goodbye, but his decision is understandable. Love you Ginobili!NOOOOOManu :( I will love you forever!Thanks ManuWhy :( Wish him the best moving forward. Love you Manu! End of an era.  Gonna miss GINOBLI!What a spectacular player.dang....legendary Spurs big three officially gone...Damn. Congrats to Manu on a legendary career. 1st ballot. üêê     It‚Äôs been a real rough time to be a Spurs fan this past year, lol.

He along with Timmy gave us all more than they ever needed to and I thank them and especially Manu.   As a Mavericks fan, fuck you Ginobili.

One more for old time‚Äôs sake: GINOBILIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!  The bat slaying legend, it was a pleasure watching the man playtek de plejGEE-NO-BEE-LEEEEEENow the only thing left in SA is really them big ol women.We should have the ceremony when Toronto comes to town. And in Springfield in 2023.  It's getting crowded up there. Duncan gone, Parker gone, Ginobili gone, the whole Kawhi fiasco. Definitely a turbulent time for Spurs fans to say the least. If that‚Äôs the price to pay for the dynasty I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt mind Truthfully, a jump start on the youth movement is actually pretty exciting for spurs fans. Our team has been "old" for a decade and a half.  The kawhi situation being resolved is more of a relief than anything else. Better to cut a team cancer out than to let it fester (as we learned with Dennis rodman).Never a terrible time to be a spurs fan. We had a pretty good off-season, made the playoffs last year.... Whats terrible about that? One thing to be excited about:   It‚Äôs time to cheer for a whole new squad. I know it sucks to lose a dynasty, but now there‚Äôs going to be new talent. Some will work out, some won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll be an up and down next few years but it‚Äôs EXCITING.   Source: am Pacers fan. We‚Äôve been doing this for ~20 yearsThese violent delights have violent ends Yeah gee, must be absolutely awful, sorry you had to go through that. - Sincerely, Hornets, Kings, Grizz, Knicks, Bucks, Magic, and Sonics fans (who am I missing, lol?)I‚Äôll take 20 years of brilliance followed by a couple of years of only being really good with new players please. Lol I do not feel bad at all. I‚Äôm sure the previous 20 have made up for it.  You had your two decades, though.  Change is inevitable.Neither did Duncan, I feel like they prefer it to go this way. He actually got a pretty good send off in game 4 of the Warriors series in 2017. Whole crowd was chanting then standing ovation when he subbed out for the last time. Then he came back lolhis olympic team send off was pretty awesome. bunch of argentine fans outside the stadium when the game finished singing for him. go find a youtube clip if you haven't seen it.Last game in SA against Golden State he took over in the fourth quarter and prevented the sweep. The crowd was going absolutely nuts and I was on my couch crying. It was a proper send off for a low key guy like Manu. Just the way he'd like it to be. Not everyone is an ego maniac. I think he did. I went to that game 4 playoff game and the arena was so loud. I dont know if there's a video of it but he went down and the entire place was chanting his name. I think he will be fine with how it ended for him. I think him and Duncan probably found Kobepalooza genuinely distasteful.OH SHIT NOW THEY'LL STRIKE MANU WAS THE ONLY ONE KEEPING THEM AT BAYDon't forget the block on Durant  https://youtu.be/Hm9Y-vqZsEo  Or the insane stuff on Garnett. One of my favorite blocks ever  https://youtu.be/hCqefcY7lpI  Or his dunk on the Lakers  https://youtu.be/Db123b2UZxg  Its crazy to think just how long he's been good. Like a lot of vets stick around forever and don't really do much (Vince Carter for instance) but Manu has been a closer for his entire career, up until the last game he played in the NBA. Truly a legend. His play between the years '03 and '05 was astonishing. Everytime I watched him play it felt like he was the most unique player in the NBA his fundamentals, his athleticism was so one of a kind it felt like and watching as a European the way he schooled all the American athletic freaks was a sight to behold. His game was so different it looked like every other player was doing something wrong.>Possibly the best entry pass ever  This is definitely going to be his legacy  E: highest ever upboat (saying very little) is a misquote where I dropped the /s. I'd think his legacy would be overall accomplishments across all levels, a key role in the Pop/Duncan dynasty, best 2nd rounder ever, and getting rid that pesky bat! #GraciasManuFinals dunk on Bosh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDa5dpHzvTYMy favorite moment perhaps was the three he hit in the ‚Äúscreaming lady‚Äù playoff game against the Warriors (2013?).Man at first I was ready to hit the downvote button on you so hard. I'm glad you were being sarcastic lolI know right, I mean he's only a   4√ó NBA champion, 2√ó NBA All-Star, 2√ó All-NBA Third Team, NBA Sixth Man of the Year, NBA All-Rookie Second Team, EuroLeague champion, EuroLeague Finals MVP, 2√ó EuroLeague Finals Top Scorer, All-EuroLeague First Team, Italian Cup MVP, 2√ó Italian League MVP, 2√ó Olimpia de Oro, Diamond Konex Award, 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors, and FIBA AmeriCup MVP.   He's got slim to no chance at the hall.His international career just barely pushes him over the top. ^^^^^^/s  Best European ever.Seeing Manu, Tim gone and Parker in a Hornets jersey makes me really mad as a Raptors fan. For us Argentinians it really is sad, a friend that used to play in a basketball club when he was a kid in Bahia Blanca (Manu's city of origin) told me that when Manu made his debut in the NBA, tons of kids started practicing basketball, the club he played for got like 4x bigger, Bahia Blanca is known as THE basketball city in Argentina (it always was super big on basketball but Ginobili helped a lot). What a fucking legend.Jokiƒá.How is Manu regarded compared to some of the top soccer players in the country?  Is he put on the same pedestal in terms of notoriety and fame? Obviously not as popular as Messi or Maradona but what about compared to like Tevez? Man, the only game I went to AT&T was the one a group of hermanos were there to cheer like the crowd in Argentina. The passion was incredible.  People like to talk about Maradona and Pel√©. I prefer Manu and Oscar. Y sos hincha de los Lakers? D√©jate de joderYou just need to go to [www.lanacion.com.ar](https://www.lanacion.com.ar) , one of the biggest argentine newspaper, to see how much Manu meant for our country in general . The text on the middle says "A legend has retired: Manu Ginobili has put an end to a glorious career"If it makes you feel better, that block made my whole year. Release the bats Senor Manu of Casa Ginobili, Olympian of Argentina, Winner of Rings, Best of the Sixth Men, Drawer of Charges, Stepper of Euro, Shooter of Clutch Threes, Blocker of Harden, Catcher of Bats. Light the beacons.> I respect this choice to not milk a retirement tour.  Flair checks outI expected him to play for at least another 10 years The absolute madman‚ÄúSoon‚Äù. - Durant‚Äôs HeadLebronJET and Vince next. Dirk's still got another two years... right?? Hold me famMemey response but actually probably true, I bet if Kawhi was playing  he would've done one last year.Doesn‚Äôt this make Patty the longest tenured Spur lolthis is the worst timeline...TP is the only one left standing now on another teamn-nani :(When I saw shams my heart droppedI shared a flight with him in '14. Shook his hand. I was starstruck. A new eraFHis phone is set to do not disturb while driving, he will react once he safely arrives to his destination. His pager went offOld Navy is his nickname for David Robinson. Pop: ‚ÄúNot bad for a guy we brought in as the water boy‚ÄùTHANK YOUI'll always love this gif. tony trying to hold back his giggling the whole timeI almost forgot about that gif!! Pretty much resumed how close their core were. Duncan showing his true psychotic natureBREAKING: Manu retires to become Court-side Animal control OfficerNumber one in the league in stolen bats.Joker could take a lesson from Manu.Man, he fucken KILLED that thing! I remember PETA being pissed about this.Not all heroes wear capesThe fuck is a 10 bat? Is grabbing two impressive?Michael Jeffery Jordan would have never even let a bat in the building. He would have willed his team to a completely pest free season.   -SkiiiiiipHe got rabies treatment just in case.I don‚Äôt think he realized at the time how dangerous it was‚Äî he had to get rabies treatment and made a PSA basically reminding the public that it‚Äôs not advisable to swat at bats with your bare hands lolFOR REAL. I go for my 3rd round out of 5 of rabies vaccines tomorrow because I found a bat in my bedroom. Would not recommend. It's a silent killerWhat about McGrady?Didn‚Äôt they actually get upset about that or am I making that up my heart has brokenY'all look so different nowI only got really into the NBA this last season and I'm so full of regret that I didn't watch much earlier, mainly because of the Spurs. Such a unique organization in the league with enduring stars, multiple generational talents, the world's team and all that.   And I fucking missed all of it, except one awkward season with Kawhi drama. I own several jerseys and none of them is for an active Spurs player. It's a weird feeling.LOL yeah. Time to go towards the youth movement for better or worse. I wish we still had parker lol but there is a log jam at pg.How is it demonstrable already?Suns fans aren't allowed to like anything SpursI hope he‚Äôs there to induct him into the HOF. GINOBILLIIIIIII#**GINOBILIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!**Against the Hornets so TP can be thereWould prefer the Suns or Mavericks or something. So we can actually win on his retirement night.Nah, do it against the Pistons. Allen I-verson was with us when he said "I don't know any franchise players that come off the bench" and "I don't know any all-stars that come off the bench" despite Manu already having an all-star appearance and 3 rings on his finger. Show him what happens when you check your ego at the door and do what's best for your team  Edit: Not to make this about my least favorite athlete of all time, but Manu's greatness was why I was so angry when that happened. Manu always put the team before himself and it paid off beautifully. The only negative things I could ever say about him are that he wasn't a Piston, and he beat us in '05. Enjoy your retirement, Batman, we'll see you in the HallSimmons gone, Green gone, Anderson gone, Pau's contract, Patty's contract, Pop on his way out and Aldridge isn't getting any younger.   Just like Kyrie, we may look back on Kawhi's trade request and realize that he was just proactive in getting out before the team collapsed around him.   Pop‚Äôs wife passing as well.I would've prefered it to have been less dramatic and drawn out but yeah. Can't complain after 20-something years of this. Can confirm. Knew Duncan, Parker, and Manu couldn't play forever but enjoyed it immensely while they were with the Spurs and the 5 rings that came from the era.  Excited to see what's next.They also are in a pretty good setup going forward. You usually don't end a dynasty and lose a big 3 like that (not to mention lose Kawhi and Danny Green the way they did) and end up with two all stars on your team.Overall you're right. Strings of success like this are insanely rare. But this past year has still hurt a ton. We have reasons to look back and get over it but when every reason you loved the spurs in the first place is gone (or near gone) it just stings...Yeah seriously i think the original commentor is blowing things a little out of proportion... I am really excited and its been a good off-season tooDerrick White is gonna see some playing time now. It's weird looking at our roster and seeing two guys that should be big contributors (Dejounte and Jakob) on rookie contracts along with two guys that have good potential on rookie contracts (Derrick and Lonnie) when we've been so old for so long.  As sad as I am to see Ginobili go, him retiring will mean our younger players get a lot more playing time which in a way is good.I guess they mean if you were very attached to the players that made the dynasty.I don't think the original comment meant it in that way.. we did have a good off season, but it's also really sad to lose Tony and Manu.  It's more of a sentimental thing, it hurts to see them go.  You almost forget that Duncan went out the same year as Kobe's goodbye extravaganzaThat‚Äôs just that era of Spurs 101. It was absurd watching these normal seeming guys dominate the league, and then after their run, a quiet departure for each. Nothing to see here, no bigger-than-life exodus; just some guys playing ball. On to other things. Yeah the Spurs mentality is truly a thing It speaks to the greatness of the unselfish mindset embedded in the Spurs organization that all of its great players go out without much fanfare. Its how you know they were really about dat lyfe.Classic Manu move[deleted]Yea I was there, it was rough.  Not sure that counts or not, but it def was powerful.https://youtu.be/zQdpUFfYd70  Sound quality is terrible and loud[removed]Being in the crowd when Manu hit the dagger 3 was a transcendent experience. Ugh, this just makes me dislike the Warriors moreI was at this game. Tickets were only like 70 bucks on SeatGeek because the Warriors were up 3-0, the sweep was supposedly inevitable. I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go, at least I‚Äôll get to say I saw Manu‚Äôs last game in person‚Äù. Then he went and basically held off the Warriors by himself. He hit a spinning shot as the shot clock expired, then buried a dagger three from the corner with about a minute left. He had jumped in the hot tub time machine for a few minutes and the place went bananas. At least now I can say I got to see his last win. [Him making faces on the bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVVKMb1hdhw)  Lmao getting the farewell you deserve does not make you an ego manic.[deleted]lmaoo kobepaloozaBATMANUYeah, for his whole career he was just fearless. Going against bigger, faster, more athletic players, and doing it in a way that just made it seem like he was seeing things they didn't see. But he wasn't just finding open spots and capitalizing, he was creating offense, going right at bigger guys, and somehow making things happen. He was a legend.He‚Äôs Argentinian...[Passing God](https://youtu.be/48WnPHE2dKk)Nothing but love for Manu, and he was great at distributing the ball, but has everyone gone crazy and forgotten Jason Williams? (I realize this is a homer sentiment.)I figured his competitivenessQueue the highlight reel!Include Olympic gold medalist thereYeah he's from Argentina Wait is the second sentence /s too? Am I being wooshed?I see what you did there. Isnt more popular than Messi or Maradona but Messi have a lot of haters for the the performace in the national team and Maradona for the style of life. Manu dont have detractors. I think is the athlete more loved outside of the footballIt's different games. Tevez is probably more "popular" in the day to day sense. Sport media will probably talk more about Tevez normal days, but in overall Ginobili is much more than Tevez* Sometimes he is defined as the best sportman from the country, even more than Maradona (which may sound logical if you care about what he does outside the pitch), and than Messi (I guess because Ginobili made Argentinian people happier than Messi did).  He is definitely in the top 5 sportsman of the country. He is mentioned regularly alongisde Maradona, Fangio, Messi, Vilas (tennis), etc.  * Ginobili will be the cover of tomorrow newspapers, tv will prepare special shows for this, etc. This won't happen when Tevez will retire at all.He is WAY bigger than Tevez, he is the icon of this sport in our country, its like a whole different kind of pedestal if you know what i mean, but ofcourse  Messi and Maradona are higher fame and notoriety wise. I hope the Argentinians keep showing up to Spurs games.Balanced, as all things should be.Yup, all three of them are next. Sad. I started watching the nba in 2003. This is a sad feeling watching all these legends leave. Time went by too fast.You think TP would also have stayed?Idk, Ginobili said once that his "expiry date" for retiring was 40. I doubt it was easy for him to choose but he kind of expected to retire now no matter what happened around the team.Yes it does.  Spurs veterans are old Trail Blazers now. :(Patty Thrills baby. Got a bit lucky choosing him as my first jersey last season I suppose.It does. Patty and Belinelli are the only two guys left from the 2014 championship squad, and Beli is just coming back from a two year hiatus. Outside the coach and GM, yesThat's Hornets legend Tony Parker to you At least it's not the Suns or the Lakers.Good BotStrong driving fundamentals Timmy takes public transportation or occasionally carpools. It's much more economical. URGENTPop continued, "he was a shit Waterboy though."THE LOB"goddamnit"  - the same batI would watch this show. Sounds like a weird baseball stat before some rule change in 1850 What's that per 36I would assume Manu and MJ were the only NBA players with pro at-bats.  Sure, but their roles and playstyles are very different. And I am not sure if Manu would teach a player from Denver.It's interesting to see different reactions from players. Manu (and the crowd) were clearly all for him taking out the bat, then you have Randy Johnson hitting the bird with the ball and feeling terrible.And he didn't even kill it! He stunned it. According to team officials, it was released and flew away perfectly fine. He got a rabies shot. *in the arms of an angel*Good. I enjoy when PETA gets upset. Manu Ginobili ain‚Äôt scared of no Batman.I was going to say two but his career highs are so ridiculous. So I went back put 10 and forgot to erase the two.The questions I need answered Duncan made sure he did.  For safety.We don't talk about thatAnd Mario Elie.They did. Had an article on it. It's still up online NBA dynasties never die.  They ^just ^^fade ^^^awayI can't get erections anymoreSame mi corazon tambien, mi amigoStick with it, there will be more! There's new storylines every season, ever decade, heck seems like every week in the NBADisagree. While I still don't like Bruce Bowen/Rob Horry for obvious reasons, you can still appreciate while having someone else as a rival.  The meaning is little diminutive because I am originally from Texas though.Fuck you for telling the truthMavs pls Manu sacrifices a lot for team success. I think prime Manu could‚Äôve been the original James Harden if he went of to lead a teamI do like the motive behind this idea.   Could do it against Houston and Melo too for similar reasons. the first 3 i don't think are that huge of an impact. Pau comes off the books soon and Patty's contract isn't terrible as long as he isn't starting. Trying not to sound like a homer but I don't think loosing Parker and Ginobili will be that bad for us. Emotionally it absolutely sucks.   The team still has 2 All NBA players and a good supporting cast.Bruh, Kawhi leaving was never the problem. It was how it was handled. I know you like shitting on the spurs, but pretending that Simmons and Anderson leaving are game changers is absurd. Green is only gone because kawhi decided to leave. Otherwise he'd still be on the roster..> Pop on his way out   He hasn't said anything so that I do not include in what makes me sad. He wanted DeMar because he didn't want to rebuild. If he were leaving in a year, he could have taken all the Boston picks. [deleted]What about DeMar DeRozanHope your team doesn't take the turn the Pistons took in 2009.See: Redwings, DetroitWe never went back to back. I'll kill myself over that.why we acting like you guys rebuilding? You mans making playoffs There are lifelong Spurs fans who are now married with kids who've never not seen their team in the playoffs.  And even if the looming bad karma from the Basketball Gods is starting to rain on you, you guys are *still* a god damned darkhorse in the playoffs this year.two *all-nba players  Except the Spurs and the game of basketball itself.   Let‚Äôs not be melodramatic here. Teams are always changing and evolving and pieces are always moved. We unequivocally got better than last year. Our second option last year for long stretches of games was actually Ginobili.Our draft picks in the last few years have been very exciting, in true Spurs fashion. So excited to see what Murray and Walker can do in particular. Murray looks like a potential All-NBA talent, while Walker is lottery-standard, and if nothing else seems like a hella charismatic guy. Of course i am lol but im celebrating their career, not crying about it. Very excited to see our new era of young guys as well. But definitely sad to see him go, he was still a great contributor last yearOf course we're attached to them but they can't play forever man. I'm excited for the future People forget that year was the Spurs‚Äô best record in franchise history It's why I'll always prefer Duncan to Kobe. People always say that you need to be an egomaniac to be great, as an excuse for Kobe's and MJ's actions, but guys like Duncan, Dirk, Nash, Anthony Davis prove that you really don't. Lol Kobe's goodbye tour or whatever it was called was pretty fucking ridiculous honestly The way they went out reflects each of those players so wellKG also retired that offseason as well Hahhaahah i never knew about thissee u/HeisenSpurs linkWhy? All the Warriors on the court stopped to clap for him when he went to the bench, Curry even stepped away from the foul line to make sure he got his proper sendoff.  The Warriors won the series, but the whole league has huge respect for Manu - and that includes the Warriors."YOU DESERVE A FAREWELL AND I WANT TO SEND YOU OFF!"  maybe you're the egomaniacYeah it's like celebrating your bdayArgentinians are basically Spanish ItaliansJesus it must have been so stressful being on the court with Manu, you were never not wide open when he had the ball.   You were one moment of lapsed concentration away from getting a ball in the face and becoming a highlight, or finishing an amazing play and becoming a highlight. Modern Pistol Pete. I didn't see this in that highlight reel:  [best pass I've ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV-HXok_ysw)If you look at the scores in each highlight, they're almost always up. Insane.0:27 LMAOOne of my faves was last season when he threw up an ally oop and it ended up just going right in for the 3 and nobody believed it.Just on entry passing I think manu was better. Jwill is def the better overall passerWhy does nobody list Duncan's bronze medal when listing his accolades?It's a Barkley reference. He thought Ginobili was from Europe, despite being a huge fan like he said, europeanLadies and gentlemen, [Charles Barkley](http://awfulannouncing.com/2014/charles-barkley-called-manu-ginobili-one-of-the-5-greatest-european-players-ever.html)*It's simple.

I feel like a lot of the people drafted in the early 2000s are retired but soon the Melos and D Wades will be retiringMe too mate me too, before starting to support the spurs because of manu, my favourite player was dirk.

Spurs legend.watch the Spurs win 50 and make playoffs again Sucks... but we will have to just push rope.I'm not sure Spurs fans consider it a rivalry....Parker should be thereExactly. You guys got DeRozan. People sleeping on that or just straight up forgetting about itIt would have been foolish of the Spurs to match the contracts of Simmons and Anderson. Instead of being able to start anew, the San Antonio Spurs would be the San Antonio Hornets.The comment lost all relevancy once it compared the Cavs roster minus LeBron to the Spurs roster.Spurs FO is arrogant as others in the media have said and they have a right to be because of their success. Which is why they didn't go the tanking route with picks. I'll be surprised if he coaches in the NBA for more than 1 year. I think he'll coach next year then retire to focus on coaching the olympic team without distractionsWe really down with disrespecting Simmons now? If we didn‚Äôt let him walk we still would‚Äôve had Kawhi.r/spursworldproblemsYes, that's definitely a shame.   *stares at "Made the Playoffs" banners*boo hoo45 seasons of basketball as the Spurs, **only 6 losing seasons**.   I think you'll be fine. [https://imgur.com/gallery/FvpBBRu](https://imgur.com/gallery/FvpBBRu) *Laughs in Timberwolves*We can‚Äôt even make the playoffs back to back years :‚Äô(Indianapolis had Peyton Manning for over a decade and only got one ring.We almost did it twice, and we would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling SpursLmao come onScrubsAnd even those two years were 0.4 and Manu fouling Dirk for the and 1, 2004 and 2006. Not making excuses just pointing out to me they were anomalies. Really shows you how dominant Timmy was during that time. I‚Äôve always looked at the championships like this:                        2004   2006 1999‚Äî>2003,^2005,2007‚Äî>2014Going B2B felt great and i can't even imagine the 3 peat you guys took from us.   However I would have traded it for the run you guys had!Won 5 in the last 20 years, haven‚Äôt missed the playoffs this millenium, 19 years of 50 straight wins.    I first became a Spurs fan during the Rodman/Robinson/Eliott Spurs so I do remember some of the less successful years. But yeah, you‚Äôre right, even with all the turnover, Spurs could still finish anywhere from 4th to 10th.As a mavs fan...I'm going to cry when Dirk retires but I too am excited for the future of my team. Wasn't even the best record in the NBA that seasonDuncan, Dirk, Nash, and Davis have another thing in common - they didn‚Äôt play their entire careers for the leagues marquee franchise. Context is kind of important for understanding Kobes farewell tour.Kobe did most people a favor. He gave everyone around the country to see him play a last time. I would have been super sad if he didn't. I don't look at his early announcement as ego. It was just a tank in disguise. Provided another compelling storyline for the season for a team that sucked willies. What each town would do for his sendoff and that final game. I aint mad.If by ridiculous you mean ridiculously awesome. Watching old man Kobe chuck on a tanking team was a sight to behold. Kobe gave zero fucks. It was his year and everyone in the Lakers organization knew it and was behind it. Plus, didn‚Äôt he drop 60 his last game? Legendary stuff.The Lakers were godawful anyways though, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have done it had they actually been competent. The Spurs were still competitors the year Duncan retired.Why do you care? Are you an egomaniacmaniac?I meant watching as a EuropeanI bet there are enough plays for another highlight video of "teammates flubbing easy baskets after not realizing they were open before Manu did"Imagine how frustrating it would be to play with anyone besides manu after playing with him. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you laser a forty foot behind the back bounce pass between the defenders legs? I was open!‚ÄùWhat the ever living fuck  r/blackmagicfuckeryAchievements with Team USA are significantly less impressive than achievements with any other teamExactly, he's from Argentina, he's European.You fool! That was Charles Barkley!I'll give Barkley the benefit of the doubt on that comment. He did come over from Europe because he played for Virtus Bologna in Italy's Serie A.To be fair, he's a huge Ginobili fan but not a huge geography fan.He is above them if you ask me.  Its messi/Maradona first, second Ginobili, then the restWe have  Vilas remembered as the best tennis player from Argentina.> Del Potro  Willy Vilas would like a word with you.He had haters beacause he refuse to play in the Davis Team por few years.  The Argentinian are very conflictiveFuck ZazaGood BotTim Duncan knows that the NHTSA now recommends holding your hands at 9 and 3.I still miss long hair Ginobili.Did pop really say this? Because I could easily picture him saying this.Yeah wasn't PETA all mad about him hitting the bat and shit?> To bludgeon a 4-ounce animal to death, it takes either a small man or a totally unthinking one‚Äîwith no respect or consideration for lives humbler than his own. This is a time when athletes in particular need to be on their best behavior around any animal and show that they have brains and a heart, not just reactionary brawn.  They linked their articles about Michael Vick in the original statement.If it had a ticket then yeahHow do you forget that you're supposed to be in charge of a bat.I mean, is it really that big of stretch to say the Spurs will win 50 games this year? That wouldn't surprise me at allVery unrelated, but the day Westbrook broke the triple double record against the Nuggets I had whiskey dick, and was just pushing rope as you described it, and trying and failing to get it on with my girlfriend, and i eventually ended up missing pretty much the entire second half of the game and not busting a nut, and to this day I think back upon it as a tragedy. Shoulda just watched the game...Thanks, Boruto's Grandpa.And clutch ass Rudy GayI think people care more about the Spurs than they do the Cavs though. Watching a dynasty in it's end days is different than the Cav's situation since that dynasty is still playing, just in another city. Pop is a smart FO guy. He wants to coach. Otherwise, he could stick Messina with more picks. I think he told LMA he'd coach longer when trying to get him back. We'll see.  I think keeping busy is the best thing he can do after just losing his wife along with all the change that has happened with the team. For 20 years straight. 19 years of 50+ wins.  We had a good run, boys.Cry me a fucking riverOof. That's tough stuff.Yeah maybe you guys will make the playoffs again in the next few years. I miss the Spurs Mavericks playoff battles. Yea but both teams went home without a ring anywayGo awayI don‚Äôt think he means that announcing his  retiring was egotistical. I think he‚Äôs talking about the other aspects of their life when he‚Äôs comparing them to people like DirkIt was good for Kobe, the Lakers, and the NBA.  Only people who would be mad about it are hardcore Kobe haters.  Goodbye Kobe was the most likable KobeAnd that after game speech tooIt's maniacs all the way down.Argentina is that little country to the left of Spain, right?Also lots of Argentinians have Italian backgrounds and Italian sounding names.... And Ginobili sounds pretty Italian. He won thefirst copa davis with the team. Any haters of him have to be gone. Del potro could have been on the level of the top 3 If it wasn't for all his injuries [deleted]I mean, they're not wrong there. But bats can carry diseases, and can bite, especially when, oh I don't know, they're in an arena filled with 18k cheering people. Gotta get rid of it. Try not to kill it, but do what ya gotta do.   Anyway, my real point is that PETA is shit, and it's super hypocritical coming from an "animal rights" group that, not only has [stolen people's pets on occasion](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/peta-taking-pets/) but also euthanizes [~85% of the animals it takes in](https://www.petakillsanimals.com/proof-peta-kills/), many of which they didn't attempt to house. Naw - take a team with 47 wins, then add DeMar Derozan and Jakob Poeltlt. Someone make an argument that we aren't at least a 51 win team and I'll give you a nobel prize.  PS - r/NBA - we are now one of the younger rosters in the league, surprise, surprise motherfuckers!!lmaoI‚Äôm trying to find a silver lining and moral to the story but all I see is that to live is to suffer :/ what a damn shame guy, my condolences As you told your ol' lady that your dick was fine. And to find a new slantFNOOOOO IT'S RUDY GAY!!!!Give yourself a pat on the back  You guys deserve it.[deleted]Cry yourself a Timberlake.I haven't seen a reminder in a while so I'll do the honors  The 73 win Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the 2016 finalsBest year in Cleveland history :)Which explains OP, he‚Äôs a Raptors fan and hated the farewell tourNah, that's Peru.Also a lot of Argentinians have German backgrounds but I was told we're not supposed to talk about grandpa and his war medals anymore.It is.Yeah they even get pissed when i choke my chicken Jacob Poeltl isn't a huge boost and we lose Green, who was a key part of our chemistry, Slo-Mo who was a decent contributor, and add another guard, who, despite being a star, does not address some more pressing holes.  This also doesn't account for losing TP and Manu, who were also key culture pieces. The West gets tougher and your 3 best players are DD, Aldridge, and Rudy Gay. Y'all will be a very good team, but I don't see 50 as a guarantee. Plus one key injury and it's over in that conference.Congratulations on becoming the Buddha. The moral is there‚Äôs no shame in being too drunk to do the doI hope the raptors win a chip in our lifetimes Ugh I can‚Äôt wait to win the championship this year. Just hand it over already We can‚Äôt let the world forget.16 seeded UMBC beat number 1 ranked VirginiaAfter beating the Thunder while down 3-1 in the conference finals.Thank you for your service In the year of two thousand and sixteen, the National Basketball Association's Golden State Warriors, based in Oakland, California, blew a three games to one lead in the two thousand sixteen National Basketball Association Finals despite having a regular season record of seventy three wins and nine losses, the best record in National Basketball Association history, and the first ever unanimous Kia National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player, Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry.Some dude ate horse shit that yearhe's not a star but Poeltl is easily your best big man defender/rim protector.   also say whatever you want about their game, but Demar and Poeltl are both high character guys and will definitely buy in to continue the spurs culture.Poeltl is a HUGE boost over Joffrey Lauvergne. Getting anything from our backup center spot will be immensely helpful.[deleted]Poeltl is who I am most excited about in that trade. A legit 7 footer, with a nose for defense and athleticism? How is he not a huge boost over Joffrey? Hell, I fully expect him to be starting by seasons end. If he can develop a jumper he could be huge for us going forward I mean he's only 22. Danny had fallen out of the rotation considerably late last season. His defence is amazing to have but his offence was a real problem. Slo-Mo was similar, he was a nice, versatile option but his jumpshot didn't improve at all last season (I really thought it would with the jump in minutes).   DeRozan actually does address the _most_ pressing hole, which was offence. Having a star 2nd option to take the heat off LMA was our number one problem last season. There are some questions about how well they'll fit together but it has to be better than what we had on offence last year.  As others have said, Poeltl is a considerable upgrade as backup center.  Losing Manu is definitely a blow. Tony was functional off the bench but would have played an even smaller role if he'd stayed this season. Is your main argument that we lost chemistry and culture pieces? And watch ball instead The Warriors doing their damn best with signing KD and Boogie. Dang 79-9As is tradition Idk Poeltl's skills but LaMarcus was a really good defender last year. I'd bet he's the best big man defender and rim protector. Dude fuck lavergne omg what a waste of space. But we lost so much I think we will be fighting for 8thWe‚Äôll keep adding superstars at a discount every year until the jokes cease.
r/nba, >Hayward has broken his leg  >Hayward has broken his leg  >Hayward has broken his leg   Damn you could hear the shock in Kevin Harlans voice.Never seen anything like this live. Oh wow. I hope for a quick recovery im never jumping againWow on opening night...poor guy that‚Äôs gotta be roughJust the sound when he lands...you can instantly tell something is broken And just like that you're reminded how much you like a person. All the frustration with him leaving is so stupid. I really don't think I'd feel worse if he was still on my team.  Feel so bad for the guy.How on earth do the teams go back to playing basketball after thatRose looks like he's gonna cry :( This isn‚Äôt good for any fan. This part of the game sucks. I feel sick... wtf poor dudeno...."Heyward has broken his leg, Heyward has broken his leg"  Holy fucking shit, this is fucking surreal and I couldn't believe it when I hear it and just watching it this is just getting goosebumps. FUck man this fucking sucks.This is so fucking sad[deleted]I had literally just turned the TV on was set to enjoy my first minute of the NBA for the year and one of my favorite players goes Joe Theissman wtffffffI'm not re-watching that literally had to look away. that looked so fucking bad. pray for hayward.damn man.. I liked him.. Hope he recovers 120%Kevin Ware PTSD flashbacks I don‚Äôt care how long it takes for him to recover, as long as he recovers fully I‚Äôll be happy  Glad to hear the cavs fans cheering him on  EDIT: holy shit Lebron is a [saint](https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/920448607173709824) No matter how many times he screws us over I never hate him because he‚Äôs such a good guyYou can tell LeBron noticed right away. This is horrible man...[NSFW: Pic of the injury](http://i.imgur.com/JycTMMT.jpg)I don't care what team you root for. Nobody deserves that injury and I'm sorry C's fans. FUCK INJURIESI said "oh fuck" minimum 30 times. Oh my god I can't believe I just saw that I don't even watch NBA or sports but Hayward is a fellow League of Legends player and big supporter of lolesports, so I'll be praying for my brother to recover fast and 100%. Fuck everything.GoosebumpsHoly fuck that is so sickA little context for r/all. Gordon Hayward is one of the best players in the NBA. He just signed with the Boston Celtics over the off-season and it was hopes that he (along with Kyrie) would be able to give LeBron and the Cavs a run for the Eastern Conference title. He just broke his ankle 5 minutes into the season. This is bad for the NBA.       You may remember Hayward from when he took the Butler Bulldogs to the NCAA Chapionship and just missed a 3/4 court shot by a few inches to beat the Duke Blue Devils. 3 inches from the greatest sports story ever told.    There is also a meme out there about him https://pics.me.me/gordon-hayward-went-from-ill-have-her-home-by-9-18735377.pngWatching that shit live was traumatizing. On my tv you could hear it crack. Thoughts and prayers for Hayward. FUCK. [deleted]That was the worst break I ever seen. Gotta pray for the man My jaw is on the floor Fuck my ass.Picture this. You're an NBA fan. You follow off season every day in the summer. You keep up with every free agent signing. You see Kyrie get traded to Boston. You see Cavs fans getting scared of Boston after getting Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Season opener is Celtics at Cavs - the projected eastern conference finalists. You're enjoying the first HALF of the first QUARTER and then you hear the commentator "HAYWARD HAS BROKEN HIS LEG" in horror. You see the camera cut into an uncomfortable close up fully showing the injury and Hayward's entire facial expression of pain. You see the camera cut away almost instantly. You see every player on the court showing nothing but sadness.   This was awful. My heart goes to Gordon Hayward. I wish this didn't exist. WOW.  Worst I've seen since Livingston's injury.Harland's call was eerily disturbing. He knew it immediately- only person on the court who realized it. PRAY for the man#Hayward is a tough Mother Fucker.   Edit: I learned Bolding my comments annoys people today.     put this NSFW  EDIT: Appreciate it‚ÄúSomeone, please‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat is it Gordon?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI need to see‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho? Your wife? Your teammates?‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy contract. My four-year guaranteed contract. I just want to hold it.‚ÄùGod, I'm shaking right now, that was so bad. I know people always talk about White LeBron, but in terms of injuries, Hayward really was like him. Every time he would have a hard fall or sprained ankle, he'd just lace em up tighter and play on. Hopefully there's no ligament damage.Holy shit this is reminiscent of the Kevin Ware injury...this is insane. Gordon has worked so fucking hard to get to where he is, this is just unfair...Holy shit I just saw it bend.No fucking wayOmg as soon as Kevin Harlan said it I feared the worst.After watching Kevin Ware and Paul George snap their legs imma sit this one out and trust y'all that it was bad. Dude I'm literally in tears... Fuck basketball or anything, his first game on the team and fucking this shit...Why would they show it holy fuck Thought process:  Awkward landing, hope he's ok  His shoe fell off damn...  oh....  OHH...  OHHH FUCK   HIS LEGS ON SIDEWAYSFK ME MAN dude wanted to play with celts and his coach and only got 6 minutes in the season and he out for the yearWas at the game and just so happened to be taking a picture the moment Hayward landed  https://m.imgur.com/a/7MWE3fuk !!!11RIP Boston's Season  10/17/17 - 10/17/17Serious respect for the camera crew and announcers.. They said it in the moment because of the shock of it but after that they stayed off of Hayward and focused on the Celtics team trying to regroup. Seriously classy.fuck Mia Kalifaomfg! watching live, jesus!UnfuckingbelievableIf anyone wants to see,  https://i.imgur.com/zbOIQx4.jpg  The noise it made was insane. As soon as I heard it I jumped up in pure shock. Hopefully it isn't career ending. Great love by the Cavs and their fans.   Edit: I took a picture to show my old man, before anyone says anything negative.Our season is over. Unbelievable.   UNBELIEVABLE.   I just pray he will come back strong. Damn man this is literally the 2nd time Derrick Rose has witness this. The first was back during that 2014 Team USA Inter-Scrimmage with PGI hope Hayward can ever be the same player again. I mean, your first hope is obviously just for his long-term health as a human being in general, but I think that's not a worry with this injury (but I'm not a doctor). After that, I feel comfortable hoping he's the same after he recovers, but first and foremost I just hope he's healthy long term. He's got a wife and kids, way more important than basketball. Prayward.I DVRed the game to watch later and now I'm watching it and it's such a weird feeling knowing that when the clock says 6:50 that it's going to happen.  It's like in Interstellar where Matthew Mcconaughey is screaming at Merv in the past but she can't hear him. I need some space strings to pluck so he knows just to let that rebound go.   Edit: or ally oop  go fuck me man, that just made me scared for everyone on the court/#‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ GORDON,TAKE MY ENERGY! ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§At least now he can play all the League he wantsHayward took that calmer than anyone else, hope he comes back soon as possibleYou know its horrendous by the way the Cavs reacted I was excited all day for tonight... then I saw the injury and all excitement went away and I just felt horribleThis is so surreal.  The game was on in the background, my two-year-old is trying to tell me something, I glimpse over at the t.v. and see Wade hunched over looking concerned.  Then I see the entire Celtics team huddled and praying.  I sit up.  The commentators are not talking.  They show Lebron, head down, devastated.  Then they finally show Hayward.  Oh fuuuuuck.  I fucking love basketball and this is heartbreaking.  holy fuck I literally just started following the Celtics as a Bruins fan. I am bad luckDamn Hayward is about to get really good at Starcraft.Went side ways. That's a Paul George. Season over for the Celts :(Cavs bench nope'd the fuck out of there real quick ‚ÄúTNT we know drama‚Äù    ...not like this TNT, not like this. It's looks bad.. real bad Why can't we just fucking make the NBA like 2K with the injuries off? I hate shit like this. Unbelieveable.  A sickening injury. Will completely overshadown opening night & put a dampener on the hype that was leading into this season.  Get well soon Gordon....... his foot was almost pointing the opposite direction  I need JesusFuck. No. I was waiting for him to explode this season. Not like this.  Hope he recovers quickly.https://twitter.com/celtics/status/920453173587963907   #NEBHInjuryReport: After a medical evaluation by Celtics/Cavs medical personnel Gordon Hayward has been diagnosed w/ a fractured left ankle.It was interesting hearing Harlan talk about the difference in football injuries and basketball injuries with the distance to the crowd/announcers and its so true. Hayward was no more than 10 feet from a bunch of fans. I was like damn he seems really sure about that how does he know HOLY FUCKING SHIT THATS AWFUL seriously. hearing that made the shock worse for meEspecially the "oh g-" right before he said it.Harlan is the best play by play guy, period.  Any sport.   The silence after the above was the right thing to do.  No need for inane bullshit and over analysis when something like that happens.I was half watching the game and I heard him say that and got chills.Yeah that plus the reaction of the Cavs bench....fucked up. 6 mins into the season, prime of his career, first game with his new team...far out.it reminds me of the Kevin Ware injury.  Especially how horrified all the players were.  EDIT: I get it, Ware's was worse.  It was the reaction of the players and crowd that reminded me of it.Check for Paul George‚Äôs season-ending leg break.  Just as gruesome Paul George's injury was worse tbh, you could see the bone was sticking out of his leg. Players on the bench were tramautized and cryingI remember seeing Paul George break his leg live. Couldn‚Äôt believe that shit Saw the Paul George leg snap live... hoping Gordon comes back the sameI‚Äôm fucking sick. Those injuries give me chills in the worst way I was opening my beer, looking at the PC and heard Harlan freaking out. Couldn't believe what I was seeing at first.I just ran up the stairs on all foursYou don‚Äôt have to jump to do this. I suffered a nearly identical injury earlier this year (including the sound and the right-angle foot) on a light hike. Slipped and twisted as I fell and heard the POP.   It‚Äôs a rough path from here but a full recovery (in at 80% after 6 months) down the road. seriously wtf man that was the most routine shit, backdoor alley-oop play gets read and defended. jesus christ I'm reinventing basketball for safety reasons. No jumping, no running, no contact, no defense. Its in our best interests First game as a Celtic :( 6 minutes in man that's so brutalHayward ran that same play at least twice a game last year.  Freak accident.less than 6 minutes into the game too. just fuckProbably had the entire season mapped out in his mind before this..First quarter no lessKevin Harlan's genuine horror in his call too. i was trying to study and a buddy texted me this happened and now i can't focus. this shit is so depressing. can't get that sound out of my headyou can also tell by the way his leg folded on itself  pray for the manIt was so fucking loud holy shitExactly. I feel sick. Gordon was the man in Utah. I'm legitimately choked up. If I was angry or bitter before, now I'm just heart broken. I just want the man to get better.[deleted]I didn't even think about Jazz fans until I read your comment.  I am so sorry. God damn.I feel sick to my stomach. I loved the guy, then hated the guy. And now I'm hoping for the speediest of recoveries. Such a rollercoaster of emotions right now.Yeah. All my irritation for him leaving and leaving the way he did is gone in that one moment. I don't want to see this happen to him. He's a good dude. I just hope he makes a full recovery.Fuck everything about this. Come back strong Gordon.Love this comment. Hayward seems like a stand up guy, horrible to watch this happen.I don't even want to watch this game anymore.Like some have said in this thread I'd be afraid to jump for awhile after seeing that in person hell I don't want to jump after seeing it on TV. Exactly. How the hell can you bring yourself to jump in the air after that shit? He knows what happens next. He knows this could potentially derail another star's career and he knows it's fucking brutal. He knows what is like to go down for a season... Pretty sure Kyrie was afterwards. Surrounded by his teammates, leaning his head on Baynes.The worst part is there's absolutely nothing you can do about that.Celtics look dead inside right now, too. This season has just began and it's over for me. Celtics got no chance at beating the Cavs, and nobody will dethrone GSWI am in shock, the season is already over. This fucking sucks. I feel so bad for Gordon. well, that was a fun 5 minutesThat is fucking awfulI'm sorry manThat was absolutely fucking wild to hear. I couldn't see his leg when he fell in real time and then to just show his leg like that was hard to watch How the fuck are these guys going to be able to go out and finish this game after thatmy split second thought was. "how can he even know that right away" and then.... yeah.Reminds me of, "Holding on to his knee. Holding on to his knee and down."That is going to be an infamous moment in NBA history.I always hate how announcers always ~~diagnosticate~~ diagnose injuries in the moment, so when I heard "Hayward has broken his leg" I was like, oh come on, now you can ~~diagnosticate~~ diagnose a fracOHMYFUCKING GOD HE BROKE HIS LEG.  Edit: Sheesh I am operating on low levels of sleep, sorry.I literally turned the game on and two seconds later heard that quoteI wasn't watching the game since the TNT website wasn't working for me, and a friend told me that Hayward broke his leg and I was in disbelief, so I went here and watched this... why the fuck did I do that I'm an idiotI literally did the same thing. I turned it on 10 seconds before it happened just to watch one minute before going to the gym. I don't know if I can work out now. My shitty stream just got done buffering and this happened. My gf thought I was dying from how loud I screamed I rewatched it like 4 times, shits crazy.With the Paul George one, at least there was something you could blame it on and fix with the stanchions.  Here, there's nothing you can do -- he just fell badly.It reminded me a little bit of Shawn Livington's injury( in how strongly visual it was). I really hope he can make a comeback like Shawn did.this literally just gives that fucking sick feeling in your stomachThat SOUNDED terrible oh my godThe silence in arena. It gives me chills.I feel so bad for him. God that is awful. Fucking brutal. It happened so fast too, poor guyIt's so bad. I cannot fucking believe this. WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY SHOW IT?? Fuck that shit [deleted]Same - seasons done for us anyway now just has to focus on recovering and getting right for next year I'm so sorry, couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, I still hope we'll get a good rivalry going.I think Thompson is the one who noticed it before anyone else. He looked down right after Hayward spun himself around then turned around so fast I thought he was going to throw up. At first: "Oh thats not too bad, weird that his shoe fell off"  5 seconds later: "Oh FUCK"medical peeps with more experience: is it broken or eversion dislocation?  edit: if u dare watch the vid again, his lower leg snaps and completely gives out on himWow. When I saw it in tv, I initially thought it was a dislocated ankle. Holy fuck. OW No offense, but there's no fucking way that link isn't staying blue.Looks like it could possibly be both the tibia and the fibula. Or maybe a total dislocation (looks more like a break though). Probably some torn ligaments there too. I don't know if the Achilles could remain intact after an injury like that.   Man that is awful. I think if it were higher up things could be better but with it that low I think it could possibly be career ending depending on what the damage to his ankle is. It makes me sick, I'm not a fan of the Celtics, but I have a respect for them, and him, and jesus christ... that was too much. I feel so bad for Celts fans, shit, NBA fans...I don't really follow basketball. What do you mean when you say "bad for the nba"?fuck Fuck FUCK!!!!!! Yes and no... you're assuming it's a clean leg break and not an ankle with ligament damage As long as there's no ligament damage.Clean break? His foot was completely backwards. Everything in his ankle likely broke or tore. Have you never seen Paul George's leg injury?havent seen it and wont. Kevin Ware-esque?How is that going to heal Haywards leg?Dude just broke his leg and you're still want some sexy time?you got it my dude, it will all be over soonI‚Äôm so sad. I had to look away word man. holy shit they were taking him off he had a straight face and was shaking lebrons hand and stuff. I wouldve passed out and potentially died from shockNSFLPoor taste? Definitely. Funny as fuck? Yes.It‚Äôs a joke you‚Äôre making, but it‚Äôs also the truth.  It‚Äôs the absolute worst thing that could happen to Boston, but the silver lining for Hayward is that this won‚Äôt affect him financially.  He‚Äôs already gotten paid.[All Celtics fans reading this.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/offended_zoidberg.gif) 'I need.......a tailor"thankfully nba contracts are guaranteed, he'll get every cent. Lmao. That was good. At least for his sake he got paid before this happened. I know it's not about the money, but I'm glad he didn't do this before he became a free agent. Poor kid looked disappointed...he will be back.Fuck man, I feel you. Despite our mini-hatred for each other, I don't want bad shit to happen to any Celtics players. This makes my stomach turn, that shit was terrible. Fuck man, I really hope things work out, but right now I'm more concerned about that thing being career ending than season ending. I don't think the camera crew realised how bad it was. The commentary picked up really quick but the camera cut away immediately. I atleast hope that's that case[deleted]Because people want to see it, like meKyrie was there both times too :/Your body kind of goes into shock, so you don't really feel the pain as much as you do the burning sensation that comes with the nerves being inflamed. So, really, it's when you see it that you panic. The same thing happened to me when I broke my arm in half. Didn't hurt as much as it burned and when I saw it is when I reacted to it. The human body is weird that way.He's in shock dude. You could hear the bone break on the basket mic. That was my reaction. I was doing something else and wasn't paying attention to the TV, and I turned to look because I heard the shock in Harlan's voice. The words were still registering when I saw Hayward's leg and went into shock at what I saw. That was exactly what I was thinking. At first I was like "how is he so sure that he broke his leg?" Then I was like "OH MY FUCKING GOD, HE BROKE HIS LEG."I feel like you can hear it crack, either it's his leg fucking snapping or something else happens at the exact same time but GOD DAMNFor real.  That's the first time I've been watching a game and the announcer instantly knew how bad the injury was.I can't even bear to watch. I'm so sorry for HaywardHe really is fantastic and his voice is iconic.   Still always weird to hear him commentate football though[He's funny when he needs to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wopy6Ntd834)That shit was awful. First time I'd seen a live game where somebody's bone was sticking out. They just kept showing it over and over too.   All I could think bout was, "Why is there no blood?"  Edit: The look on the teammates and opposing team was pure horror too. I remember some of the players immediately dropped to their knees and covering their faces and heads like they had just seen a ghost.Kevin Ware's was fucking gruesome as fuck. His bones were literally in half and sticking out. That shit was fucking nasty.  With Gordon, I still can't figure out what actually broke. I just know his leg is not what it's supposed to be.Only two injuries I can even compare it to: Ware and Livingston. Can‚Äôt believe I watched all three happen live. Just horrible horrible injuries. I do that shit anywaysDid it to my arm. No pain really, nothing approaching what you'd think anyways. Just immense pressure, like someone was standing on it and a case of phantom limb. Screws and a plate, nine months until I could pick up a gallon of milk.   This brought me right back to that moment. I couldn't finish my dinner.   Best of luck in your recovery, dude.... Crosses off "light hiking"  I'm sorry for your loss >First game as a Celtic :( 6 minutes in man that's so brutal  Yup. Hasn't even played at home yet (tomorrow night). Our season is fucked after 6m. FML...Bogut-esque Ingles to Hayward oop, happened all the time. This is nutsWhen Livingston wrote about his injury, he said it was just a routine layup until his career was derailed.First game my dad and watched together ever. He got up and walked out saying he'll never watch another game this season  Edit: ...wordingThis is why we play the games, no one is a lock to win anything. My gf and I were wondering...what do you think he's thinking more 30 seconds after it happened...ow this hurts so bad? Or fuck my season might be over? I couldn't believe my ears when he stared saying tht. it didn't look like a hard fall. totally caught by shock. Is this what it felt like when Bulls fans heard ‚ÄúHolding onto his knee...‚ÄùDude is a true professional. My reaction was "oh fuck oh fuck"I think the call made my skin crawl more than actually seeing hte injury itself.I don't I have ever heard an announcer sound so horrified since paul george's injury Assuming this is similar to what Paul George went through during the Olympics a few years ago, let's hope this is a 6-9 month full recovery period and he will be back in his prime next year.  Even though Hayward isn't flashy or anything he is honestly one of my favorite players to follow and watching it live you knew it was bad before you even saw the ankle.   Even though I am a Cavs fan, I really hope he heals well and fights through this. Next year I hope he comes back with more fire from within to prove himself and the Celtics for just an awesome seasonYeah you can totally tell it's broke cuz of the way that it isI was in shock and confused because it happened so fast. And then they showed his wife crying. That was when I lost it. This sucks all around. On top of just the injury, I‚Äôm sure Hayward couldn‚Äôt wait to prove he was worth all the hype and drama surrounding his free agency over the off season.  With the league dominated by only a handful of truly competitive teams this year, the Celtics knocking on the door of the finals last season, winning the FA pitch for Gordon and the storyline between the Cavs/Celtics rivalry that was made stronger when they traded for each other‚Äôs star PGs... for this to happen on opening day is just crushing to Gordon, his team, the league and to the fans.One small silver lining of this injury is I can probably wear my Hayward jersey in Utah again without hearing "fuck that traitor."> Gordon was the man in Utah.   He had gas in the tank and money in the bank He was also the man in NBA 2k14 , my player was a pg and he made buckets soon as I passed the ball.I dont think anyone should be happy about it. Id never wish an injury on these guys, especially if I were another player. I think it's fair to say that every basketball fan is shook by this. Same. I‚Äôm still watching though but now feel guilty watching This comment just made me sad about Rose again. The basketball world was robbed of a healthy Derrick Rose. I hope Gordon comes back like PG13 did. I wish I could lean my head on Baynes right now. Fuck.Yeah it wasn‚Äôt a dirty play or anything. Just shit luck I can cry...Not with freak accidents like these. Nope. There's definitely a lot that can be done to reduce injuries associated with wear and tear, but this shit can happen to anyone at any time. Fuck. I feel awful for Hayward. They just carted him off and the crowd cheered but he just shook his head like "thanks but.... fuck"Tbt 2008I know we literally just saw this, but is that a season ending injury without even knowing what it is?It's not necessarily over but I mean holy fuck. You cannot make this shit up. We looked really solid in those 5 minutesThey were looking so good too :(At first I thought it was his ankle... I just hope his ankle ligaments are not damaged... I bet no one wants to leave the floor now, id be terrified to jump after seeing thatThis completely changes the season too. The narrative of the rivalry between the teams is going to have a serious stain on it.Nobody is safe from injuries it's sad afDon't you put that evil on meThey panned to drose for a few mins there and dude had PTSD written all over his face Let's hope Gordon comes back stronger from the injury and makes sure it's notdiagnose....?One time a few years ago, my friend fell down in his driveway and rolled over and said "oh no I broke my leg" in a panicked voice. I started jogging over to him and I said "relax dude you didn't break your leg" and then when I got about 30 feet away from him I said "holy shit you broke your leg." It was just so visually clear.   Then we took him to the hospital, parked out front, and I went inside and grabbed a wheelchair in the ER. I told someone behind the desk "we've got a guy out here, he's got a broken leg, we might need some help". The guy behind the desk gave me attitude and came with me. He started almost talking shit to me "what are you a doctor? How do you know he's got a broken leg. You don't know what you're talking about ". We got about 50 feet away from the car with the hatchback open and my friend in the back, and the guy who just was talking shit to me about it said himself "oh shit thats a broken leg"  Sometimes, it's just immediately clear that thing is broken./r/nbastreams Maybe skip the box jumps today Username checks outBruh.... why????While this is true, I think if there's one thing we learned from PG is that Gordon can come back and eventually be better than ever. God I feel so sick though  Edit: Some people are talking about how some of his ligaments can be damaged because the break is an ankle one instead of mid-calf. I think all we can do for now is be optimistic about a recovery until we know 100% what damage was done. Even if we find out it's the worst case scenario I'll still be pushing for Gordon to make a comeback.Better to break a leg than totally blow out a knee like that. Still an awful injury obviously. It looks more like Paul George's injury. To me Livingston's own was much worse, I believe he blew out his whole knee rather than a broken bone. Not sure though. Reminds me of Kevin Ware. That one made me so sickYeah I regret watching this. Haven't cringed for a basketball injury like this since Kevin WareI'm not sure I can watch the game anymore. Stole any emotion right out of me. Yes, put on headphones, close your eyes and you will know EXACTLY when it happens.  It's gross.OH MY FUCK I DIDN'T REALIZE.  Jesus that's terrible :(Considering how fast they switched away, I don't think they even thought it was that badThe live cameras aren't even panning over to him right now....fuck man I can't imagine what he's going through physically and mentally.They didn't go back to it. I think they just needed to explain why Harlan was saying "Hayward has broken his leg."They snapped away as fast as they could, but at that point it was visible.That was fucking disgusting It was nasssty, but if they didn't show it I'd be hunting pics of it on reddit..  Hell, even though they showed it here I am. PG lost a lot of his vertical and speed though. He just compensated by improving his mid range gamePaul George's was further up in the leg though, this could really fuck his ankle up for life. God, I hope it doesn't come to that :(Damn. Yall bounced back quick. I don't even like the Celtics and I'm bummed af.Yeah, not too bad until you realize that his foot is still in the shoe.Yeah my exact thought process when I saw it liveShit I also thought it just looked like his foot was just half in his shoe. Pronation eversion fracture. Medial malleolus fracture with a huge bending force at the tibia with a high fibula fracture probably as well. The syndesmosis is completely fucked. He's not coming back this seasonThere hasn't been a lot of parity in the NBA these past few years. What that means is that the same two teams, The Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, keep making it to the finals against each other no matter what. Hayward going to the Celtics was a big move and allowed a new team to potentially beat the Cavaliers and go to the finals instead. There are less legit challengers for the finals in the league now.That's true, looking at the still image it's dangerously low. You'd like that to be in the middle of the tibia.Or Kevin WareHave you never seen *Shaun Livingston‚Äôs* leg injury?I think this is comparableIt was inside of his sock so it wasn't nearly as goreDo yourself a favor and don't watch Not that bad. But it was dangling.   *And by not that bad I mean not Kevin Ware level bad. It was still reaaaaally bad. No visible bone but his foot is as out of place as I‚Äôve ever seen. Horror movie level.His ankle just snapped. Completely sideways. we gotta try everything, manMan has priorities. Or woman. Regardless, they know what they want.Adrenaline is a hell of a drug, you'd have been just the sameI'm laughing at the reactions he got  some of yall need to calm down, the man didn't die/r/ATBGEI'm happy he got that contract so worst case scenario he's filthy rich for the rest of his life  Hopefully he comes back 100% thoughYa call me sick but I'd rather get at least one look at wtf happened than see absolutely nothing when a player gets injured and just be left wondering what happenedand the guy in the background saying "OH SHIT"I'll never forget the sound of Kevin Ware's leg snapping.Absolutely his ankle. Yeah the ware one was worse seeing it live for me because you could see the bone where it had snapped   Not trying to minimize Hayward's but man Ware's was something else > All I could think bout was, "Why is there no blood?"  The tibia and fibula and lower leg have a surprisingly small amount of blood vessels. There are also no major arteries that lie in the lower leg. The closest major artery is the femoral artery in the femur.   Edit: Someone brought up the popliteal artery. Yes it is the closest, but the same idea stands. This time I think the most devastated player was Derrick Rose. I saw him kneeling in disbelief, I think he can best relate to Hayward.I remember them saying with Ware a player threw up when he saw it. His tibia definitely snapped in half. Hard to tell if the fibula did or not. dude stop watching games live plsPaul George's leg break was pretty comparable and fortunately he made a pretty quick recovery.Livingston's was probably even worse, his knee was just completely ruined. Another dog on reddit spotted.It‚Äôs fun as fuck to run up the stairs like a dog when i'm really drunk and coming back at night, i do this to get up my stairs safely. Nah you guys are fine, you need him for the playoffs though Randle-sque minutes not secondsI was so happy when I saw him back. Even happier when I saw he got a chip. little dramatic of himhe was just trying to get out of watching with you /sIn my experience it's the latter, I obviously can't speak for Hayward but most of the time when I hear people talk after a serious injury they aren't complaining about the pain but either "did the play work?" Or "holy fuck I'm fucked"Not trying to start a petty fight, but what were you watching? That fall was horrifyingThat pan to under the basket...fuck...Still too soonCome on, man. Didn't need that right now.OH yeah for sure. Its a little different though, this is so graphic the nausea is so much worse. On the other hand with Rose you already knew that first night he was never gonna be the same.   Who knows with Heyward but we at least saw PG come back from this  God damnit. I thought I had forgotten that. Ima need a gif of thatExtremely well said. Hate to see such a young and improved player like that go down. haha shit this was my first thought after all the initial shock died downI haven't been able to watch any of the game after it happened. I'm literally sick to my stomach It‚Äôs like the Paul George injury. Everyone is upsetYup.. just like when you've finished your porn, sit there in disgust but your hands are too messy to close the video..D Rose looked a little D  Rosey tonight. I hope he can make one more great run.i think he will, knock on wood, rose and pg had very different injuries, a clean break versus tears and other ligament damage is a huge difference. Looks like gordon has a clean break, he should *knock on wood* have a pg like recovery. Still waiting on the MRI god im still waiting on the MRIFuck, I wanted Hayward to underperform in Boston but oh my god I'd rather have had him dominate than this.fuck, i am sorry guysIf both bones broke google tells me it's three to six months recovery. It's possible he could be back for playoffs.  edit: To everyone telling me it'll be longer, okay. I'm not a doctor I just googled "Tibia and fibula fracture recovery".Our chance at winning the East is over for sure. Unless Tatum and Brown turn into All Stars.It's overIt‚Äôs pretty much over. The little hope we had for a finals appearance just went out the window. Hope he makes a full recovery, but we‚Äôre fucked for at least the next two seasons.Praying Hayward makes a full recovery.  Great talent. I honestly wanted to cry after PG's injury the first time seeing it, you just feel bad for the player.  Celts have proven to be resilient tho, you guys will adapt.I mean, the Celtics definitely don't look focusedI'm afraid to stand. I'm just going to scoot on my ass from this day on.  Hope his leg heals cleanly.Yeah fuck that I'm never leaving the ground againNo doubt, our slim chance at a finals appearance is gone. Hopefully he can make a comeback next year stronger than everIt'll still be infamous. I still remember when it happened to Shaun Livingston.my prognostication is that he doesn't know diagnosticate isn't a word.I was there right after thanks haha, but velocity's stream wasn't working :/ works now though thanks!I'm morbidly curious The thing I'm worried about is that PG got a little bit lucky to have no ligament damage, but Hayward's break appears to be in an area of the leg with a higher risk of ligament damage than George's.Leg breaks in the mid calf heal stronger than they were before. Promblem with breaking it at the ankle is there are a ton of ligaments in that region. I don't think his leg broke, rather his ankle completely detached from his shin, ligaments and all Yeah, i meant visually. You're totally right about Livingston's being worse. To me it kinda looked like what Garbajosa went through his first year as a Raptor( come to think of it Calderon has had to watch some really fucked up shit in his career)I wish I wouldn't have clicked. This sucks in every single way.One of the times I've hated HD photos. Could see the marrow üòñThat Kevin Ware injury was like watching someone open a straw, just punching one end through the paper wrapper while the rest bunches up and crumples beneath the opening.Feels like the soul was sucked outta me. I could care less about the result. I just wanna know if Haywards okSame. Went from being thankful it's finally nba season and hyped to watch arguably the best opening night game ever, to literally feeling like I want to throw up. Not at the disgust of the physical injury, but just sadness. It took a few seconds to realize what happened, especially cause the play was going on, and then everyone realized at one what happened and even the commentators were shookEven the 3 seconds they showed felt like too much, holy shit.~~Marv Albert~~ Kevin Harlan just said that he broke his leg, they must have thought it was just a fracture or something, not that he freaking twisted his ankle almost clean off.I thought he had his shoe partially off...nope I‚Äôm sick. Fuck. Poor Hayward :(Unfortunate choice of words...Oh fuck poor dudeReminds me of Kevin Warethe shit was on backwards. i'm sweating hard over herePG came back and his team was gone. They're under the assumption he's gunna come back fine. I'm not so optimistic.  Obviously I feel awful for Hayward but our whole teams future could easily be fucked for years because of this.And that's his left leg, so the foot is definitely not supposed to be angled that way on the left leg...Wait... explain to me plz.... how does that.... what..... I can't tell if you're making those words up or not.That is heartbreaking. Poor guy. Quality of life suffers for anyone with that kind of injury, let alone a professional athlete embarking on a huge new step in his career. Can you dumb that down for me a bit? lol  Did his ankle broke off from his shin or something?in layman's terms: he fractured his ankle while his ankle turned outwards, which puts a lot of stress on the tibia (shin bone) and fibula (the other lower leg bone which is smaller and weaker) and likely fractured his upper fibula (close to knee). Syndesmosis is the ligament attaching the tibia and fibula together and keeps the ankle joint nice and tight, and is likely torn too.   As far as prognosis, hard to say without seeing the actual XRay. each different injury isn't that bad but the combination is what makes it a little bit worse. If the medial mal fracture (the bump on the inner side of your ankle) extends all the way to the tibial plafond (the actual ankle joint) it makes the fracture even more unstable. That and his foot's twisted about 90 degrees the wrong way. Or you'd just not like it at allKevin Ware unfortunately takes the cake hereI'll never get over watching the Ware one live. Could not look away for some reason [deleted]Or Anderson Silva?Or Joe Theismann?I think the graphic part may be hidden by his leg sleeves.man I fucking hope so for his sake. wouldn't wish that kind of pain on anyone. never broken a bone (not a serious one anyway) so can't even imagine what that experience would be likeProbably too soon for a lot of fans right now.  I honestly thought that was Hayward saying thatKevin Ware injury NSFL NSFL NSFL  https://i.imgur.com/LMe6JcF.jpg   Bonus: bench reaction https://i.imgur.com/tsXkj3i.gif      I remember casually watching it while spending Easter with my extended family who is very religious.  Just out of pure reaction I stood up and shouted "WHAT THE FUCK'They said in an update on the broadcast that it's his ankle, which really sucks. Tibia and fibula is better than what looked like a disconnected ankle.   So fucking horrible. I feel terrible for Gordon. Fibula probably went too. If enough force was there to beak the tibia, and that rotation. Probably bothIt's his ankle[This is a reference photo](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/image_article_collections/anatomy_pages/493x335_ankle.jpg?resize=646px:*&output-quality=100) for the speculation I'm about to make.  Your lateral malleolus on your fibula and medial malleolus on your tibia make up a "U" shape that the talus fit into and moves within. The talus is essentially the first bone of your foot if your looking from legs to toes. Both malleoluses, along with tendons and ligaments, limit the left right pivot of the foot around the ankle.  Reports are saying that he broke his tibia which probably means he broke off some chunk of his medial malleolus which allowed the foot to over rotate into the ugly looking position it ended up in.  Usual fix is to surgically screw the malleolus and however much other bone came off back on. Maybe a plate too.I don't watch a ton of games live and of course when I do this happens.  I don't want to watch basketball anymore.Severe PTSD We all dogsWeird shit about randle is it was completely no contact. He was simply jumpingBoston sports fans. I was watching the ball. Just seemed like a normal hard fall out of the corner of my eyeMe tooThey started showing the replay again during the halftime show and I had to immediately turn it offThat‚Äôs why you have to use a box...I hope he can make one more long continuous run of 7 seasons of great basketball I wanted the same thing too but fuck man, I wish he was beating MJ's records rather than this. Probably 3 to heal, but to return to NBA basketball even in 6?  Idk  Fuck man that was awful, can't even enjoy the game anymore.There's a LOT of variables. Were any muscles torn? Nerves severed? Was it a clean break, or did any bone splinter? No point in even trying to guess if/when he'll be back right now. Ligaments also might have sustained serious damage there though.Tatum is a rookie, even if he's a future top 3 in the league he won't be able to get to this high a level in 7 months.   It's fucking horrible, I'm sick to my stomach.Why two seasons? He will be fine by next year. Tatum and Brown will get loads of minutes, improve, and make the roster stronger heading into next season. Hayward will be back eventually. He didn't destroy his knee like Livingston did. This isn't a career-ruining injury...just a gruesome one.How could they be... It's crazy and painful enough watching even as an opposing fan on tv, I can't imagine being his teammate and watching it happen right in front of you. Fuck man  Hope he comes back healthy like pg13I'm not going to watch the video, but let's see how clean the break it. If it is just a pure fracture without any significant ligament or tendon damage, he could be back by the playoffs. The actual strength retraining from muscle atrophy will be the biggest concern in that scenario, but as this isn't necessarily an ankle or a knee from what I've heard, his long term prognosis would be perfectly fine.   He may consider working on his landing like Curry, Drose, and (hopefully) DSjr did. That's a very underrated skill in the NBA is knowing how to fall. Every player out there should be practicing it. Look at the Bogut injury. What a horrible way to try and land. Its not a concious decision, but that is the point. It must become muscle memory through practice. Judo would be a good offseason training to go through for NBA players.    Edit: Just saw the picture... It's hard to image that it is completely clean. I'm just hoping there aren't any severed arteries. The soft tissue damage is almost just a matter of course for that kind of a fracture, but that doesn't necessitate ligament or tendon damage. He's going to have a hell of a few months. Hell of a half year. The hardest part is waiting for the surgery and the structural recovery to reach the point where you can actually do something about it. That's the worst part. Just laying there thinking how fucked everything is. It's great when you can get to rehab and actually feel like your are being productive and doing *something* other than just languishing in the pain and suffering. The psychological trauma. I really hope his got a good support system in place with his friends and family. Some guys come out of these injuries stronger. Look at Gore in the NFL (bad name to choose I know). He had multiple ACL injuries in college. He had every right to just give up. But he didn't and he's played his whole NFL career with the weight of those recoveries giving him strength and pushing him forward instead of holding him down. I hope Gordon gets that Mamba mentality. Green Mamba.that was my hypothestication as wellOr maybe we‚Äôve witnessed the birth of a new word. Diagnosticate: to predict the diagnosis of a medical practitioner. No one needed to see that injury. Half the stadium was running away from it.  The TNT stream is always shitty for me. Unfortunately about 30 seconds before the injury it finally kicked in to full HD for me. Now my leg hurts I was thinking the same thing, a bone fracture on the tibia is one thing but a broken ankle has so many more things to it (ligaments, etc.) than just a bone fracture. Very unfortunate no matter how you look at this.Once I finish breaking all my bones I'll be so god damn strong no one will stop me!It's either a severely dislocated ankle or a complete break of the lower tibia and fibula.Fuck, just these descriptions are messing with me.  I'm staying the fuck away from that video.When I saw players walking away shocked, I knew it was bad. But goddamn I was still surprised by itI don't know about you but I heard it through my TV speakers every time they played it. It's HarlanA fracture is a break...I stepped into the kitchen exactly as it happened. So glad I didn't see it and I am refusing to watch the replay. And PG. I wouldn‚Äôt wanna jump for a while if I saw it liveThe reaction of the bench and players was a near carbon copyI‚Äôm not talking about team performance. I‚Äôm talking about his athleticism. I‚Äôve watched PG religiously before and after the injury and that injury has taken its toll. If PG hadn‚Äôt had that injury and he developed his current skill set he‚Äôd be doing much better than he is nowPlease never speak that last sentence into existence ever again. You just shook me.FOOT MACHINE BROKEI don't think we have the technology to find out, gonna go get the encyclopediaI read that comment giggling at the clever redditor just throwing out medical terms; thought it was a joke.  Now not so sure.pronation: a part of the landing motion of the foot  eversion: the part of pronation in which the sole of the foot moves to the outside/away from the medial plane  medial: towards the center  malleolus: the bony prominences on either side of the ankle. You know how much it hurts when you accidentally bump these into something? Imagine breaking them.   tibia: big bone in the lower leg  fibula: smaller bone in the lower leg next to the tibia   syndesmosis: joint where the tibia and fibula are connected at the ankle  tl;dr he done fucked up his ankle Med student... he's not. He's pretty much spot on, but I can't vouch for his prognosis due to my inexperience. The words he uses are at least legitimate and relevant to that area of the leg according to Google.Thank god he‚Äôs got LoLYep. I've seen many people complain of depression after injuries like this because of the shift in lifestyle that occurs. Hayward will have top tier medical treatment on his side at leastTwo bones in your leg. Tibia and fibula. The thicker and stronger bone, tibia, looks like it look a lot of damage with the position his foot came down in. Very bad fractureLigament damage and also possibly a fracture on the articular surface (into the joint). Definitely not ideal break. Can‚Äôt do a tibial nail, going to be a massive plate. Kevin Ware's was I think the worst injury I've ever seen.  You could legitimately see the bone.  The bench's reaction was really terrifying and man the players' reactions today were similar.    Because they showed it like 50 times.  Ya livingstons does it for me, dude was screaming in pain from his knee bending back the wrong way and then flopping around like a wet noodle (or at least this is how I remember it, I aint rewatching that shit)[deleted]Marcus Lattimore, Willis McGaheeI think it is. If you watch the video, you can see him begin to mouth it before they cut away. i saw it once too many times in my life   i'm good I'll add that to the list of links I will never be touching shit doesn't even look real... wtfOh fuck me I forgot how bad it wasoh my god. I have never seen this photo before. Jesus that is just awful. Cant imagine what that must feel like.Shit how did that happen, did someone fall on that leg ? What this reaction is missing is the one guard who was about to sub in and literally crawled to hold ware right after. Everyone moved away But that one dude went to right to him. That‚Äôs the seal team 6 type dude you want on your team Wtf... Did he not drink milkI'm not making that link purple.Landing on a foot 0/10 Looks like its near the joint though. Close enough. Potentially a worse injury if its at the ankle though. You can assumeSame with Kevin Warethanks~~box~~  coconutDog that‚Äôs what HGH, I mean totally legal supplements, are for. yeah it may heal in 3 to 6 but its going to take some rehab time to get back into nba basketball formI broke just my fibula and played our last game of the year 8 weeks later and I'm still paying for it 14 years later. Ankle fucked for life.  I can't even imagine.I think his foot came all the way off.pg took like a year of playing to get comfortable, and even now he doesn't drive nearly as much as he used to. a lot of the recovery is mentalThe worst case scenario (fractured distal tibia and multiple ligament tears) could be more than a year or career "threatening" in the sense that he his ankle could have severe arthritis and limit his physical ability.It's rough. I had to turn it off and get angry at Cuphead. Hayward's easily one of my favorite players so I was screaming with excitement when he signed with us. This is devastating and it has to be 10-20x worse for the playersAt this point, I really don't care about this game; I'm just hoping the game ends with no more injuries and everyone else is safe. I love basketball but winning this game is no celebration. The Celtics aren't focused. Either team isn't playing hard (which is fine because I don't want anymore injuries but just showing how the injury is affecting everyone).   Right now my mindset is still on Hayward and I'm just a fan watching the game on tv. I can't imagine the mindset of the players in the game.  I hope Hayward comes back strong man. That really sucks. Nobody should go through that.These are some pretty ridiculous assumpticatations. Stephen A?? That you??Actually I looked into it and healed broken bones are only stronger for a short period. Still,if I were an thlete I'd rather break a tibia than tear an ACL. I definitely thought I heard it snap. Brutal. 'Hayward has broken his leg. His foot has twisted 70 degrees, and is portruding out of the top of his ankle not unlike a T-bone steak. He hangs his head in utter disbelief as the reality of the situation has hit him like a child realizing Santa is not real.'No idea why this is such a common misconception. It's the same thing, one isn't less severe than the other. I had literally the opposite timing. Just came back from making dinner. Don't want to eat now. Understandable. Have a speedy recovery.   :(Im a med student; that makes sense to me. Not too familiar with such injuries and I'm fairly new, but yeah seems legit. You can look up the individual words if you like. as terrible as this sounds, hayward might actually get diamond now b/c of all that downtime. He only watches league now b/c he had no time to play before. He was plat b4 he quitHe still got a couple weeks to grind til the end of season 7!Ah so the two pieces that's closely connected to the ankle broke and that's why his foot was like that?  How's the recovery with fractures that close to a joint? Isn't easier to recover from bones fractured cleanly in half?Thank goodness haywards sock was covering the breakCrazy how Ware came back, went to GSU and had a run with RJ Hunter. The only injury for me that was worse than Ware's was Clint Malarchuk. I watched it live and only saw them replay it once.McGahee always immediately comes to mind. Brutal to watchSame here. I definitely just clicked on the bench reaction link. I'm good on that other link. Y'all can have that other link. [Want one you haven't seen?](https://youtu.be/kc0lD6Rlt8c?t=60) He had to have emergency surgery that night and almost lost his leg because he broke the leg, ruptured the main artery, tore all his ligaments, and ripped his hamstring right off the bone.[deleted]He came down at an angle and his tibia just gave way. I couldn't even look at the tv after it happened.NBA players are huge guys.  Running and jumping on hard surfaces.  small fractures and stresses build up.Hopefully it's all bone and little to no soft tissue damage.My God.....Trust me you did, I don't hear it in the replay but I just played it back on my pvr and its 100% a snap soundBecause when I think fracture, I think something got a small crack or something. This is more like a bone-holocaust.NA's last hope?Full breaks heal faster, but the real worry for Hayward is going to be ligament damage.  Man do I hope the damage to the ligaments in his foot and ankle are limited.From the picture it looks like the joint doesn't even exist at this pointThis is also the way that I remember it. Saw it live, and definitely don't remember a lot of replays. Naw I'm good fammmmm...You might be a cannibal, just sayingJesus Christ lmaoBoneghaziagain, as terrible as this sounds, there always next year for hayward and NA :/Cloud 9 still in this bby
r/nba, [Higher quality](https://streamable.com/j7eid)  [Replays](https://streamable.com/ztuxw)The look of the Raptors bench was one of the saddest things I've ever seen when LeBron hit that shot."Two points is not two points." This is LeBron explaining later. that was one casual looking game winnerlebron miracle run this playoffs manThis dude misses free throws so he can hit game winners[deleted]Are you fucking serious Whatever I hate basketball anywaysI'm not going to drive it to the rim I'm going to fade away float it off the glass because I'm Lebron James LMAO hubie's only reaction is "oh, jeez" at the very end of the video bwahahaha HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING HOLY MOTHER OF GODOFF GLASS, GOODNIGHT This man tossed up a meteor on those baby dinosaursTurn the 0-2 into the 0-3When Dr Strange saw the 14 million outcomes all them had LeBron destroying the raptors againJust when we thought they had life, LeBron reminded us all, Raptors are extinctCut my life into pieces WitnessMAMAIt'd be really great if Dad... I mean Lebron would retire already.    Fuck why am I even a sports fan.Every year we argue back and forth about who the mvp is. It‚Äôs Lebron. It‚Äôs Lebron every year. Toronto fans don't tune into game 4. I like you guys and you don't deserve this.LMAO  Edit: lmaoWhat the shit, he is on fucking fire these playoffs. Statlines, game winners, aesthetics. Jumper wet af. Just masterful.Holy fuckI'm so sick of Lebron's pass first mentality in clutch situations.Jordan wouldn't have had to use the backboard - Skip Bayless, probablyBe me, 23-year-old Raptor fan, eh.  Wake up, get out of DeMar DeRozan jersey.  Get ready to Do My Job.  Put on DeRozan jersey.  Head to the Tim Hortons next to my apartment.  One down the road sucks, eh.  Order is wrong, whatever, DeMar says coffee is poison anyway.  Shoot the cup into the trash and yell ‚ÄúDEMARRRRRRR‚Äù.  Hop on the subway.  See a Cavs fan in the front car.  Yell ‚ÄúLeBron is leaving‚Äù as whole train chants ‚ÄúWe the North‚Äù.  Tweet ‚ÄúLeBum is trash‚Äù on my iPhone 2.  Get to work, head into Tim Hortons.

Cops show up and ask how it all went down.  I call my dad and he picks up and says‚Ä¶  Hello this is LeBron James. Ho hum  He makes greatness seem routineBest player on the planet and it‚Äôs not even CLOSE. Harden durant and co aren‚Äôt even in the same league as him. Fight me on this. Anyone else see Jeff Green smirking after the timeout? I knew some crazy LeBron shit was about to go down Kill meI'll come back to this thread to cheer myself up when we get 4-0'd by Golden StateLeBron may have just ended this raptors core.   DeMar, Lowry, and Ibaka may not be here next yearWORTH MORE THAN 2 POINTS[deleted]You can't make this shit upA fucking floater from high post off glass are you kidding me. This man is the fucking goat. We are all witnesses. LeBron James is now 43-8 against playoff opponents that dont have at least 3 future hall of famers since returning to ClevelandI just watched this at my wedding. Made everyone stop when there was 15 seconds left because it was bound to happen. Lebron is fucking magic, man. I BOW DOWN TO LEDAD Here for the ride to r/allHonestly cracked up when I saw this live. Most hilarious buzzer beater everLeGoat just spirit bombed an entire countryWas anyone actually surprised by this? Because I sure as hell wasn't.Just got home from the Q. Greatest night of my life. Wow. #LeBronto[deleted]OH MY FUCKIG JESUS THE FLOATER THOWhen I see a dog I say "Hello Dog".  When I see a cat I say "Hello Cat".  When I see a cow I say "Hello Cow".  When I see LeBron I say "Hello GOAT".  OP please nerfHow the fuck is this already up I literally watched this on live TV, hit /r/nba/new and this was already here. KING SHITWow. Sorry Toronto. You tried, but LBJ just has your number. This is what Jordan did to Cleveland, happening all over again with LBJ over you.Sorry y'all but he's mvp. He gonna get robbed this yearim done hating hard work and excellence.  all hail the kingDid dis dude just did this?This.. is.. LeBronto!!! LEBRON JAMES.HOWLebron actually making a case for being the goat in these playoffs.I think we just watched one of the greatest game winners of all time.J.R. literally stands there in awe after it goes in for a good 20 seconds lol. THE LEFUCK YOUThat was the first time I have legitimately audibly laughed at a buzzer beater. How ridiculous. I want to die Literally we all knew who the ball was going to and he still comes up big again. Absolute beastInsane degree of difficulty. Absolutely ridiculous. so what hurts less, o.d or turning car on in closed garageRaptors must feel devastated. Like, this fucking guy, every year.Lmao i called itHe's the greatest of all time.someone make him mayor of toronto on the wikiWe are currently watching the greatest individual playoff run in NBA history and I dare someone to say otherwise. LeBron is the most clutch player to ever exist I wish I was born in the west so I could appreciate this without it making me hate basketball.It's like, hard to even acknowledge how great this kind of thing is.I‚Äôm not surprised by anything Lebron does anymore. He can hit a full court game winner and I‚Äôll still be like ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs Lebron‚Äù. it's... crazy, he's the motherfucking greatest of all timeMan, I know MJ gets mythologized by by people around my age and older, but I don't know. LeBrons definitely making an argument as best ever."He's not an assassin."  "He's not clutch."  "I wouldn't let him take the last shot."not just 2 pointsI'm so lucky to watch this dude play.how any of us ever thought this dude wasn't clutch is beyond meWe are watching the greatest basketball player ever at the absolute peak of his powers and there are people out there who still question this mans ability and downplay what he does every time he steps on the floor when it matters most. They might make it to the finals and get annihilated by golden state in 4 games and that should never go against how incredible this guy is. My god.Not even surprised anymore from LeGoatAdding to his legacy every night goddamnWas he foreshadowing this when he said not all 2s are 2s?I‚Äôve been on the fence about being a lebron fan. This sealed it. I‚Äôm a lebron fan for life. Harry Potter's 8 movies together are like a short film compared to Lebron career highlights video...J.R. bent over, laughing, with a look of "this bitch did it again..." is everything and everyone rnI was there. I‚Äôve never seen him play live. I blew a gasket on that game winner. I‚Äôve never felt that emotion in my life and other than my future first born I doubt I ever will again.   He‚Äôll, if he started a cult I‚Äôd sign up tomorrow. Harden's winning the MVP this year but we all know who should win it..That man kissed that shit off the backboard softer than you kiss a newborn babyIf people still think Kobe > LeBron, they lost all credibility. lmao just fucking end meThank god for Lebron Mr. James, I don‚Äôt feel so good -The RaptorsGOATLeThanos^s^s^s^s^.^.^.HE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMEWhat did toronto do to deserve this One of the guys (Delon Wright?) just held his fingers to his temples like he couldn‚Äôt comprehend what he had just seenJV throws himself to the ground out of frustrationYou shoulda seen me smh. This was the most crushing thing I've ever seen as a Raptors fanWhy would Dwayne Casey think he could put a single defender on him for the game winner?! ESPECIALLY when CLE was inbounding from full court.  Yeah, Kevin Love nearly got away with a moving screen near mid-court, but as soon as Lebron crossed half-court there should have been a trap. Watch the replay again, Fred Van Fleet is literally face-guarding GEORGE HILL. Smh Toronto just ain't ready to take that next step, they are becoming the Joe Johnson-era ATL Hawks of the late 2010'sI love Lebron but that shit is depressing. Weird to feel bad for a bunch of millionaires, but w/e. [deleted]Holy shit he probably called his shot just like last gamelmaooooo bro i forgot about that LeForeShadowTwo points ain't two points  *It's game*lmfaoGod damnLeNostradamusWait... Did he really just do that? Or is that coincidence?He made it look way too fucking easyIt's scary how good his balance is.    Like if anybody else tries that shot they at least stumble when they land if not fall over and he just kisses it perfectly off the glass too.  Just wow.Seriously. That‚Äôs the shot I take when a game of horse with my nephew is going on too long and I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore. The way he nonchalantly jogs up the court is what gets me. Felt absolutely no pressure.LeBron has officially ascended during this post season.   He has fully transitioned into demigod.   I refuse to believe he is human any longer.Just thinking of the 100's of comments I read this year about how this was the year, it was finally the time when the team was such shit he couldn't win the East for the 8th straight time.  Lel.imagine if he beats the warriors again manWe‚Äôre all just living in his worldLeBron now has more career playoff buzzer beaters than Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant COMBINEDBron's PlanI‚Äôve lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for buzzer beaters... or dramatic OT wins I‚Äôm not sure which. I won‚Äôt be silent . Just saw it live sry.LeBron has saw 14 million possible outcomes to beat Toronto... Every single damn thing included this nasty shit.yet, we all knew that was going in. It had nothing to do with how good the look was, it was just lebron. He's truly the greatest when he makes buzzer beaters almost look ordinary.He will and you will love it A running one footed floater off the glass from 10~12ft. Yep, he's completely serious. This is very seriousI went to the future and saw over 14 million outcomes of this series and we only won one. This is the only way to win the series, to lose the first 3  Turn that 0-2 into an 0-3MISSED THE FTS ON PURPOSE JUST TO MAKE THAT SHOT[removed]END METhe dude is unbelievable, thank god the thunder arent in the east he just always does this not fairAre you surprised? He‚Äôs amazing GOATWe are always here to save you guys from your embarrassment There's always hockeyI just don't have the emotional stamina to watch more than the first quarter, that shit is exhausting. Right there with you. I went from "TRUST THE PROCESS" to "FUCK BASKETBALL" really quickly.  I hate Boston sports. Of all the teams to be down 3-0 to...LeDegree Of Difficulty.   Edit: Wow. For that someone who gilded me, thank you so much! My first one! We went from LeFadeAway to LeFloater Two points isn't two points I'll explain laterEver year he misses free throws to show off and win the game with his new offensive weapons. He is just unreal.[deleted]goes so well with raptors reactions on the benchIsn't he a hater? I swear he's so down everytime Cavs made a play.He cant keep getting away with this. Man I thought I was in my Reddit saved section cause I swear it was the same exact title last week LOLI send my regards to Raptors fans. What an awful way to loseHonestly such a great callLeExtinction Event[deleted]LeBron‚Äôs PlanWe don't even win one?!That‚Äôs why he had to miss the FT‚Äôs.   ‚ÄúThere was no other way.‚Äù -Lebron to Lue after the game.

This man is unbelievable. I'm still shaking.I watched MJ in his prime.  LeBron is better.THERERemember, we have the Browns. God hates them for some reason. SPOILER ALERTOf course it's Lebron, but they'll never give him another MVP award. Seriously, why is this even a discussion? Other people might have better stats but there is never an argument for who is the most valuable player. It's LeBronDude didn't you hear? Lebron is old and probably going to get eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.Just cut off my internet.Kill me please  A huge comeback by OG only for this to happen ffsEveryone knew this was going to happenThis motherfucker decided to use a trick shot as a game winner in the playoffs...LeBron you're the GOATI legit just fucking burst out laughing at this one.

I guess the only positive is that the next once in a generation player is gonna be in Toronto.

That shot was straight unguardableEveryone called that shitPretty easy prediction, if it involves Lebron and Toronto the outcome will be whatever hurts Toronto the most.Was there any doubt?We are still witnessing 15 years later.I remember when everyone said he wasn't clutch, always shrunk in the spotlight, couldn't close out games... This is just unreal.I gotta agree, people will say it's reactionary but the last 15 years have been fucking unbelievable. That 3-1 win against the GOAT team was the best performance of all time and he's even better nowhttps://i.imgur.com/iwvywvt.gifvMost playoff buzzer beaters ever. Highest game 7 ppg ever. Definition of clutch. I remember when people used to crack the "what's the difference between a dollar and lebron? A dollar has 4 quarters!" joke at lunch in high school. How times have changed SKIIIIPLeBron surpassed Kobe in like 2009 lol who's still saying that?For some reason this season is turning me. I always said Jordan. Now its like ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Norman PowellLooked like the the end to a March Madness gameWe got ourselves a loss nowWould 2 guys have even helped there?  He put up a 1 handed fade away off the glass.

I don‚Äôt get it what is this?Shit if I tried that id prolly hit some banners and tear my ACL That's what I told all my co-workers when they said that the Raptors would beat the Cavs this year because even their bench was great. I just told them it wasnt enough to beat god himselfThen Kevin Love woke upIt's crazy how it's literally every year. I for one accept Lebronto as our overlordSent from my LeBiPhonelEbROn iSn'T cLuTcH tHoHow many?‚ÄúBut, Shannon, that‚Äôs just because MJ and Kobe wouldn‚Äôt let teams come back from 17. They were in those situation less often than LeChoke because they had the killer instinct to close games out and go for the throat when their opponents were down!!‚Äù -Skip probably*throws mouthpiece*I remember when Lebron was crucified for not being good enough in the clutch. Now look what we did.People were saying in the regular season that Kyrie wasn't being used to his full potential when playing with Lebron. It was true.   When great players play together their stats often won't be as great as if they played solo. KD/Stephen won't ever play together and average a triple double season.  But that goes both ways. And holy hell Lebron's proving this post season that he ***gave up*** those clutch shot opportunities to Kyrie when they played together.Jumping sideways. SIDEWAYS.I mean like how do you even guard against that it's just not fairThen why can't I stop laughing?He can't keep getting away with it.The only way to overcome LeThanos is to do something no other team has done in NBA history. LeThanos I love the optimism young man, keep it up!üòÇüòÇüòÇ  It will all makes sense in the long run, just wait.

Woah is that what happened Hubie?  Thanks for confirming what my eyes just saw, and the other commentator stated as it happened. Ha i read that in his voice Oh that's too bad!‚ÄúOhhhhh‚ÄùI'd receive your regards but LeBron would just steal them from me anyways.Hear me‚Ä¶ and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No. It is salvation.Not even mad about the way this series has gone. Just deeply deeply disappointed. This is 24 years of sadness. This is our best team ever. We just have to continue to face the best player ever. OG though. He's our only hope.Bron's Plan  Bron's PlanNo win for you!Have we ever seen Lebron and Thanos in the same room? Well....Anunoby  still reeling  don't give a fuck about the playoff seedingBravoFucking made me snort. [deleted]truly isI praise God every day that I can watch this man play basketballMe too. And I agree.   People just put the past on a pedestal. Once Lebron's career is in the past, he'll get the full respect he's earned.GOESit's only fair for birthing lebronHarden: Chris, I don‚Äôt feel so good The reason you know he is the MVP is because if you go through the hypothetical situations where you switch players and imagine if Lebron was on the Warriors instead of Durant, if Lebron was on the Thunder instead of Westbrook etc.   In every single situation it‚Äôs clear that Lebron would make that team better.    You replace ANY player in the league with Lebron, that team is going to win more games. To be fair this series should be giving a lot of hope to Pacer fans they are legit.#R.I.P.TORSMe too thanks lebron has done so three times alreadyOff the fuckin glass man hahahahaYeah. I saw 8 seconds left and was just like.... that‚Äôs too much time lol He‚Äôs getting bored lolI‚Äôll make love to the city of Houston if they can do me one solid andMost of us are Browns fans too so it all averages out.

r/nba,Absolutely insane game from Russell Westbrook, who has been on fire since the first quarter, where he scored 10 assists and 7 rebounds.  According to Royce Young, the only other 20-20-20 game in history was Wilt Chamberlain on Feb 2, 1968. 21 assists, two turnovers :oOh and: only TWO turnovers. With 20 assists. Please take that into account too. Crazy.I never thought I‚Äôd watch a 20/20/20 game in my life.   Most lit rebound I‚Äôve ever seen. Since Russ came into the league, there have been 12 games where a player reached at least 15-15-15. Kidd, Rondo, Harden, and Jokic each have done it once. Russ has now done it 8 times and OKC is 8-0 in those games.Watch as westbrook will strive to average a 20-20-20 in a few yearssaid he did it for Nipsey Hussle  "that's for Nipsey, that's my guy"As a fucking point guard to boot. Wilt was the only guy to do it til tonight. That's history folks.This is such a crazy era of basketball. Glad I‚Äôm here for it Statpadding with 2 triple doubles in 1 game /she got that 60 for nipseyClutchell Westbrook This is incredible; whether you like him or not, any time a "Since Wilt" record is broken/matched is *HUGE*  Edit: Also I totally called it [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/afniof/ben_simmons_has_recorded_the_first_2020_game/ee055wl/)[20/20/20](https://i.imgur.com/ePR4QMZ.jpg)  s/o /u/YouHaveBeenBaptizedRussell Westbrook tired of only getting one triple double per game.So many Russell hate threads today and the man just goes and fucks them all right up. I was hereOnly 2 turnovers, unrealHoly fuck that‚Äôs insane Only the lowest of IQ players can get 21 assistsColin Cowherd is somewhere foaming at the mouth That was for NipseyWhen Donovan sent out the bench, there was no way in hell that Russ was going out.Say what you want about him. Call him a stat padder. Call him selfish. There's no denying he's one of the most versatile guards in NBA history and just put up a legendary statline tonight. Averaging a triple double for 3 straight years...god damnWITNESSED HISTORY ADAMS MISSED THAT FT ON PURPOSE  I never thought I would live to see a 20/20/20 game, actually fucking incredible to see.Really didn't think he was going to get it with Javale turning the ball over twice and it getting below 1 minute  Just insane#‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for Nipsey‚Äù3 min ago I was like nah, he‚Äôs not gonna make it, still a great game though. This motherfucker.He got 2 triple doubles but only got 1 win. CLEARLY cares about stats over wins.I love Russell Westbrook Yesssss actually so happy for him Was anyone else listening to the Players Only commentary though?? There was about a minute left and Russ waved of Billy Donovan when he was subbing out PG and Schroeder. The crew were debating if he knew how close he was to the record books (he had 18 rebounds) and they were literally like "I don't think so, I think he's just staying out there because he wants to play," and someone else voiced their agreement too LMAO.  Then Russ exploded in for an offensive board and they were like ooohh nvm lol.  Don't mean to hate, I'd be doing the same thing if I were you Russ. Why not get in the record books and seal a win while you're at it. God-like performance from the former MVP.This man is a legitimate beast and we're probably gonna take another triple double average season for granted.The last one was definitely a stat pad rebound lmao but fuck it he got 20/19/20. WHY NOTi think its hilarious u kids talking shit about russell westbrook. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol  He's just a special athlete man.. AmazingDude is so fucking talented. Regardless of who he did it against or how I feel about him, I gotta appreciate the talent. Players only babyHe held that 20th rebound like it was his newborn child The rare double triple double.Man, that performance just snuck up on you.That's honestly insanethats fucking crazyAll I can say is damn.  Damn.In front of his parents too thats some real shit üíØ Westbrook is the most insane statline player since Wilt  people are gonna look at his stats in 15 years and consider him one of the most underrated players everUnbelievable how good these players are. Westbrook has averaged a triple double 3 years in a row and just dropped a historic 20/20/20 game to cap off the season and he isn‚Äôt in the conversation to win MVP. The game has grown so much You know, Minister, I disagree with Russell on many counts ‚Ä¶ but you cannot deny he‚Äôs got style ‚Ä¶Of course Wilt had a fucking 20/20/20 game. Of fucking course.Statpadding^2Never thought I‚Äôd see that. Incredible performance. **That‚Äôs my fucking man right there**Absolute Legend!Imagine being so goddamn good at the triple double that people no longer view that as an accomplishment so you have to go Out and pull a wilt Chamberlain stat to shut people up. what a godThis is some 2k shit Why are we acting like two triple doubles in one game is good?That is genuinely amazing. This Will Chamberlain sounds pretty goodCrazy how this doesn't even feel special to me because he's been doing crazy shit like this for years now.STAYED UP TIL 4AM FOR THIS AND MY GOD WAS IT FUCKIN WORTH ITSay what you will about stat padding, but in an otherwise meaningless game he at some point set a goal for himself and got it. Dude is covered in sweat and looks exhausted. My favorite player in the NBAThere have been over 3,100 NBA Players, only 2 have done this.And said "That is for Nipsey". Congratz, Russ. What a performance.If youre a Westbrook hater, youre not a fan of NBA basketballMan I love Russell Westbrookthat is just insaneTriple double wasn‚Äôt enough, so he said fuck it and doubled it.The historic call immortalized by the Players Only crew...Good evening, I'm Hugh Downs.  And I'm Barbara Walters, and this is: 20-20-20.--to do any ONE of those things is hard! To do TWO is one of the best games of a person's career. To do all THREE, and factor in the circumstances.. = Legendary..  -Jamal Crawford  https://twitter.com/jcrossover/status/1113274018570719232?s=21  ‚Äî  Man I dnt think people understand how hard it is to do that  CJ McCollum  https://twitter.com/cjmccollum/status/1113272852944277504?s=21   ‚Äî  Also, 20 assists on 2 turnovers. Wow.Anytime you hear of an insane NBA record that's shared with another player, the other player is always Wilt. God damnThe double triple double gameInaccurate, he actually recorded twoHe statpadded but I dont blame him, thats fucking insane.I‚ÄôM HERE AND PART OF HISTORY BOYSRussell‚Äôs energy is just unmatched man.  Call him a stat padder or whatever, but to get 20/20/20 is probably one of the craziest stat lines to get. Other players would get so much attention just for getting a triple double, and this man gets basically two triple doubles in one game. Also, for a guard to get 20 rebounds is just incredible.We're not gonna see a performance like this again in a long time, gratz Russ! RIP Nipsey HussleTo everyone saying he's a stat padder, I get it. But you have to realise that a lot of nba players will "pad their stats". What Russell Westbrook does is absolutely unheard of. Nobody in the history of the NBA besides Wilt Chamberlin has done this. So regardless of if it's "statpadding" or not, how are you not impressed? 99.999% of nba players are incapable of doing what Russell Westbrook just did. Insane.   Too many kids in this comment section.   Better respect Westbrook before I tell your parents to take your phones away.ABSOLUTE MADMANCongrats you won the race to post thisWow, incredible, glad to be wrong on if he could do it shout out to Steven Adams for that perfect intentionally missed free throw Wilt is still the only player with a 20/20/20/20,000 stat line, though. Imagine if he got Felicio‚Äôd lmaoHe‚Äôs capable of such great things.Gaddamn that's actually insaneNo fucking way  Also I called it lol (but I'm sure other people thought he'd be the one to do it too)Glad I was a witness!! Holy shit. I've been eyeing the infamous 20-20-20 stat line all year and been saying I think Russ has the best chance to get it, as well as Simmons one day. Just incredible. So glad he got it. Who knows if we'll ever see this again. We all knew it was gonna be him. Fuck yeah Russ. Play your game.I swear if I see this question on new in the next monthWhy is it always Wilt having the other record?Damn this is legit insane. Westbrook is reaching SSGSS levelsOut here with that 20/20/20 visionEvery stat has an asterisk stating "only matched since wilt".[Here‚Äôs the boxscore for Wilt‚Äôs 20-20-20 game.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/)  Took him 48 minutes like some kinda pleb /sI can't even do this in 4K.The Nipsey GameIn this thread, a bunch of people missing the forest for the trees because they saw the word "gang" and refuse to understand nuance. Sounds about white. Dedicated to NIPSEY THE GREAT!!!!  20 + 20 + 20 = 60  if you know you know .20 rebounds as a point guard is insane. 20 assists with only 2 turnovers is insane. Westbrook is a beast. One of if not the most legendary stat lines we will ever see in the modern era from a guardUnbelievable. This might be one of the most incredible stat lines I‚Äôve seen in a while. This makes me want in n out He just...decided to go out and put up the second 20-20-20 stat line in the history of the NBA out of tribute to a friend. That is absolutely absurd. I shit you not, just yesterday a guy at work was arguing vehemently that he would take Jrue Holiday over this man because his ‚Äústats are meaningless and don‚Äôt help his team.‚Äù  I‚Äôm too mentally exhausted from defending this man against Jrue fucking Holiday so I‚Äôll let this speak for itself today!Since no one cared that he's about to average a triple double for a third straight season Russ decided to drop a double triple so we'd be impressed again. Wow. Dude is crazy. this has to be the greatest triple double of the modern era right?  this is way more impressive than hardens 60npt triple doublesTriple doubles not good enough apparentlyLegendary I witnessed history u/LeBronsTampon time to fart on your wifeWilt Chamberlain, Riley Reid and now Westbrook. Incredible.can‚Äôt believe he stat padded 41 times what a cheatIt's not fair for other triple-double makers though, it was against the Lakers. "He's not a high IQ player"He has this kind of shot from time to time and it‚Äôs fucking beautiful when he doesLmao this sub can get fucked Russ is the man1 turnover per triple doubleProbably the best assist game since Chris Paul had his 20:0 game. When he had 14 at half I knew we were going to see something special If he had only 1 he would have a 21:1 A:TO ratio üòØüòØüòØNow he's only 3 assists or 1 DNP away from securing his third consecutive triple-double season.When you *and Wilt Chamberlain* are the only ones to ever accomplish a basketball feat, that means you're *really* fucking dominating.Been a huge basketball fan for 20 years. Beyond blown away it happened 5 minutes awayhas to be one of the greatest games ever played right? even if it's just a regular season game  20/20/20 is insaneI haven't seen anyone else on this thread point out that he went for 20-20-20 because Nipsey was with the Rollin 60s.I think Hakeem Olajuwon did a quadruple double onceChamberlain probably had a couple, too bad they didn't count blocks back then. Live by the brodie, die by the brodieAs a former rondo fan boy, i am going to be nostalgic for his almost 20-20-20 game forever, but Russ actually did it.If brodie goes 15-15-15 for each game, they will be unbeatable?ahthatsprettyinteresting.gifSo you‚Äôre telling me all Russ has to do to win a championship is average 15-15-15? The warriors won‚Äôt know what hit them I heard one time, he got a 20-20-20 also!!Haters will call it stat-padding, but being undefeated in those games says a lot.Damn, can you imagine how frustrating it would be to put up 15-15-15 and STILL lose? I'd be emotionally numb for a week.He should do that more often.B-b-b-b-but r/nba had me believe he put up empty stats!!!StAt PaDdErhe can average 15-15-15Average a 20/20/20 in 2020? That would be the greatest season of all time I don't think people know how important Nipsey was to LA guys like PG and Westbrook. I follow Westbrook on Instagram and he was unusually active on Instagram this week. He liked almost everything and anything Nipsey related.   I read somewhere that Harden and Nipsey were childhood friends. Harden and Westbrook knew each other in their youth. I don't think it's too far-fetched to think that Nipsey and Westbrook might have been close friends.Does anyone know what the significance of 20+20+20 is?>20+20+20=60 Y'all know what that means.  Damn. Respect.Westbrook is so lovable manCrazy mothafucka named Nipsey 20+20+20 = 60  Rollin 60s CripsWilt played 48 minutes in that game. And they don‚Äôt keep pace stats for that season but his team took 103 shots, 32 free throws.  Tonight Westbrook played 36 minutes. Thunder took 102 shots, 20 free throws.  We talk a bit about stats inflation but it does work both waysWestbrook did it against milkmen padding his stats smhFor those wondering what Wilt's statline was, it was  22 points, 25 rebounds, and 21 assists.  What the fuck. How did a Center get 21 assists?smh what a disgraceSelfish!Are we going to act like 20/20/20 on 8 of 23 shooting is good?  Edit: /s because I can‚Äôt trust reddit to get sarcasmhe‚Äôs a fuckin machine Russ is stat padding in all areas of life Does it actually count as 2 tho?‚ÄúMichael Jeffrey Jordan would *never* stoop to this level of selfishness!‚Äù  -Stephen A. Smith (probably)If this the lowest-scoring club60 of the season?RIP NIPHe just said it postgame toorest in powerWestbrook tired of getting only one triple double per game.Mama there goes that man!#BRODIE WESTBROOK Brodie/Harden/Steph is going to be looked back as just impossible. The shit these 3 guards do doesn't make sense. "I'll see you Double Triple Double to your 50 point triple double to your 10 threes and sit the 4th quarter." WTF And 21 assists to 2 turnovers is pretty incredible too (though less historic)Same here man! So glad I caught the game Russ did it. Was rooting so hard in the 4th for him to get it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ajkpyr/westbrook_against_the_pels_231716_with_2_steals/eewbt05/aaahhhh!! that‚Äôs interesting Tha meme god givethhe's done it againHow many pictures do you make before hand and not get to useIlluminati confirmedthe meme goat strikes again üëÅüëÅüëÅNext stop: triple triple double. LMFAO. He hasn't got a triple double since, let me check, YESTERDAYI honestly don't understand why people hate him so much. Is he a flawed player? Yeah but there's a difference between criticism and hateI'm pissed I missed the gameYo me too. How did we all end up here. Steven Adams told everyone to make those shotsHe cant even pass really he just throws the balls to his teammates who score for him, if thats not stat padding what is?5 offensive rebounds, can't believe Lakers let him do that. Clearly a ball hogthe most selfish players can only get 21 assists /s Lowest IQ player to ever get 21 assists A double triple double? Smh stat paddingI also would hate that my pointguard could constantly get offensive rebounds against centers. What a disgraceWhat dumb fuck has the opinion that he‚Äôs a low IQ player He‚Äôll find a way to intertwine the Westbrook criticism with his divorce  Shot 2-9 from 3 for 22%, clearly a scrub.u/jaytatum on suicide watch "Selfish Westbrook was hoarding all of the stats for himself, stealing rebounds from teammates and hogging the ball. Look, all I'm saying is Westbrook was +24 while he had teammates at +26 and +28: the stats don't lie! Also, you don't get points for beating up a broken Lakers team with no LeBron, no Ball, and no Kuzma. Give me a break. Call me when he puts up 20/20/20 against the '96 Bulls, not this stat-padder league we have today."RIP BeautifulThis is insane and no matter how much I dislike him (Sixers fan), I can't deny this is incredible Hist0ry  FTFYOnly the second ever game like that. Crazy. Other was of course WiltI honestly assumed it'd never happen again.   There's a reason it'd only happen once before. Then again, Westbrook seems to be doing a lot of cool things I'd assumed wouldn't happen again. This is such a weird night. Warriors fans celebrating Russ. And I'm somehow rooting for you guys against the nuggets. What the hell is going on You seem like a good dude :) have a nice nightWhat does everyone think Wilt was doing when he was shitting on everyone besides padding stats üòÇ. Everyone would statpad in that position and I absolutely don‚Äôt blame them EDIT: I fucking love russ man he has his flaws but gives it all everynight and an all time great, rip nipsey and good thoughts and prayers out to his family and to crenshaw. I'm glad he stat padded. He deserves the 20/20/20.The funny thing about this pasta is Westbrook actually is jacked, wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes.So many hot dudes. how I git that litle symbol up der lik dat?He‚Äôs four assists away from his 3rd straight season averaging a triple double. So.... What you're saying is....   IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, YOU DON'T LIKE NBA BASKETBALL Glad the Lakers were yet again part of NBA historyContext mattersI wouldn‚Äôt call him a ‚Äúlow-IQ player,‚Äù but he does take a lot of low-IQ shots in clutch situations Well sometimes he isI mean, when it comes to late game execution he‚Äôs often notHe isn't though lol. One amazing game doesn't dissuade that, he's an absolute bonehead in late game situations and shoots way too many three's despite his inability to shoot. Didn‚Äôt rondo have something like 25 assists last year in the playoffs with the pelicans?He had 10 in the first quarter. ~~1~~ 4 away from tying NBA great Steve Blake's record for most assists in a quarter.  e: record is actually 14 not 11.Russ had 24 assist 3 tos just this yearThat bumCan Paul Heyman still be the 1 behind the 1 in 21-1?If he had only zero turnovers it would be crazy. I don't know how to properly express the ratio when it involves a zero, but it would bonkers.The Thunder Trio seem to be Wilt's disciples. Westbrook is going home tonight to sleep with 1000 women just to beat Chamberlain‚Äôs *other* record on the same day. This exactly why Elgin Baylor is wildly underrated. He‚Äôs the only player other than Wilt to average 30+ shots per game and shoot below 50% for the season.   It‚Äôs mind-boggling.And even Wilt only did it once! Usually these records are like "only other player to do it is Wilt (seven times)".I can't believe I wasn't able to watch it üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠Double Triple Double?On two turnovers is what really blows my mind. Russ is an absurd passer.It‚Äôs almost like the ‚Äúsimpsons did it‚Äù trope.   But for the NBA, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúWilt did it‚ÄùDefinitely a great game but my one of the best ever, hardens 53-16-17 is way way crazier imo. Either way insane night for Westbrook He had a prettty bad shooting night, and definitely stat padded a bit at the end, but other than that, yeah, and incredible game.  *Live by the brodie, live by the brodie [deleted]I ran the numbers, and by my calculations, the Thunder would go 82-0 if Russ went 15-15-15 every game.Just checked and in the 46 games of triple 15 listed on basketball reference(counting Russ' tonight), 9 resulted in losses. Wilt and Micheal Richardson each once, Magic twice, and Oscar Robertson an impressive 5 times. Wilt's was a 22-27-19 one point OT loss.He's even stat padding his team's win total, why are we acting like going 8-0 is impressive? I love Russ but averaging almost 5 more rebounds and almost 5 more assists doesn't sound reasonableThe all-time record for assists per game in a season is 14.54. 15/15/15 will never happen.for real seems like basically every player around that age from LA was close with himDerozan too  >https://www.instagram.com/p/BvsdujXn10W/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=ene4hhdu97rxTruth be told, I hadn't heard about the guy before the shooting, but the more I read about him, the more respect I gain. To come from a place like he did and make himself into a pillar of the community and especially not just leave them behind like so many do, and to uplift them using his resources, not many people do that. Hopefully we can all take a step back and ask ourselves if we are making a positive impact on those around us, and try to do so if not. Inspirational life, unfortunate tragedy. his post-game interview about nipsey was legit tugging at my heart, he spoke about him like he was family I've honestly never heard of the dude before thisHarden and Nispey were friends since he was still in middle school. >I don't think people know how important Nipsey was to LA guys like PG and Westbrook.   Anyone who knows or has been following Nip for years.. knows that he wasn't just a talented artist.. but also one of the heroes of this modern generation. A hero to the entire African American community and especially in LA. He was doing so many goddamn things, all for a change. A positive change.   >  Then one of his own, murders him in cold blood. Imagine the irony  >  Nip's wife Lauren and their children.. they lost their hero as well. Tough Rolling 60‚Äôs crip. Nipseys set. Nipsey Hussle was in the Rollin 60s CripsWhy is being a crip celebratedThis is so much funnier with the Dirk flair manIf you go down this rabbit hole, consider that it was expected Wilt play every minute of every game I just want to point out that if the NBA recorded blocks back then, God only knows how many 20-20-20 games Wilt would have hadWeren't assists harder to get in the 60s tho ? Due stricter rules and stuffJust looked it up. Wilt went 22-25-21, and shot 9/13. Both stat lines are crazy.He did it against fortnite streamersWho was Wilt playing against?Won't someone please think of the children?The worst part was the 21 assists.Like damn pass the ball bro!To be fair, there are a good number of people (including professional sportscasters) who regularly comment that they aren't impressed by him averaging a triple double.  This comment made un-ironically wouldn't be all that surprising.Yes. Yes we are.Can‚Äôt tell if serious. For the average which he is close for, yes. It has to be surely2 > 1  &#x200B;  Can confirm.https://streamable.com/cqf9uI‚Äôm letting everyone else bicker amongst themselves about this and that, while I enjoy some of the best basketball I‚Äôve ever seen.https://streamable.com/sg39zhallowed by thy gamewake me up when we get to single tripleNope, next stop is the triple triple.It‚Äôs mostly personality. He gets peoples attention like Draymond, Barkley, Rodman. Polarizing players, loud and brash, invite both praise and critique.I don't know what it is about Westbrook that makes people not think he is a top tier player lol. He is insanely talented and the only "top 5 player" more athletic than him that I can think of is Giannis. It‚Äôs been said that, ‚Äòhaters gonna hate.‚ÄôI'm pissed for youI wouldn't want to upset Adams This is a great comment, good jobLmaoooo this is something I could see someone actually saying and it has me rolling. Smh Westbrook has other people scoring for him    ^^^^/sLakers boxing out themselves for WestbrookStatpadder.About half of the posters on this sub. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have great shot IQ but the rest of his BBall IQ is greatWestbrook's my dude, but are we really pretending he doesn't have some of the worst shot selection in the league?  Fucking insane game today tho, man's putting up stats you can't even put up in 2k‚ÄúThe fact that Russell got a 20/20/20 is almost as unbelievable as my wife leaving me, a golden god‚Äù -Colin ‚ÄúYou know folks, living with the perfect woman can be exhausting in marriage. You watching the game on Sunday, she is making plans for summer vacations, making dinner and inviting your parents over. Russel Westbrook is that exhausting spouse. Last night he put up 20-20-20, his teammates were watching that like an underachieving husband. that‚Äôs why he will never win a championship like Lebron‚Äù.‚ÄúGoing for a second triple double in the same game is like when you get divorced and try to squeeze in a second relationship before the divorce papers are signed‚Äù -CowherdDw bro, I‚Äôm sure he can dig up an article from 2009 about Russ missing a fundraiser or some shit.Can't wait for the new Berry Tramel article about this game.Hi2t0ry"I"m going to lead the league in assists this year." *does*   Wilt was the King of Stat-padding. Some say he even invented stats just so he could pad them. Exactly lmaoüòÇ That has been my argument for years. No yeah just to be clear I 100% agreeat least he didn't ricky davis it I mean everyone stadpads, literally. People try to get 50 or 40 all the time and always throw up the extra shot. Idk why only russ gets criticized for it     statpadding^2Lol this fuckin guy[deleted]We da bestAnd even tonight took 9 threes (making two), despite being a terrible three point shooter.Can't spell "hero" with IQ.Shhh. Not today.He can have really good passing IQ *and* poor late game decision making and shot selection. They‚Äôre different aspects of the game and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs stronger in one than the other.I fucking hate r/nba's habbit of acting like one awesome recent game is reason to dismiss legitimate long term criticism of someone. It happens soooo often here. 4 pts, 10 reb, 21 ast, 4 to.  A very rondo statlineHe had it in the regular season I think, he still went off in the playoffs thoughI'm genuinely surprised that record doesn't belong to John StocktonSteve Blake actually had 14 assists in the first quarter in 2009.  Please don't disrespect the legend.Never forget NipseyI want to see Brock on the courtThe word is "undefined."  Many laymen like to say it implies an infinitely large ratio but there's only one (simplified) one of those: infinity/1.  But if you go to resolve x/0=y algebraically, any number Y facially solves for X=0. To explain what this means further:  You'd solve this by multiplying both sides by 0 but when you do this you hit X=Y\*0 and... Well, that means X is zero. Plug that solution back into your working problem and then you have 0=Y\*0 and... Wait a minute. Hey, **anything** can be Y there - even infinity!  So if X is 0 and Y is ANTTHING that means the original X/0=Y is the same thing as saying 0/0=ANYTHING. 0/0 cannot equal anything but zero, and it certainly doesn't solve to "infinity", obviously, so that solution can't be proven.   To sum it up, since you cannot *define* it to be one singular thing through proof, the ratio is not infinite but rather it is indefinite. There is no one solution.  Source: I explain this and other stuff for beer money  Edit ~ typos, clarification, formatting.The 3 Legendary SaninDurant inherited wilts consistency and efficiency (relative to their peers). Westbrook and harden inherited the sheer stat filling potentialOr his literal childrenAssuming a night has 8 hours, that gives him 480 minutes to sleep with 1000 women, which means he needs to fuck a women every 0.48 minutes or be ejaculate in 28.8 seconds - something I could do minus the refractory period.He‚Äôll statpad with easy ig thotsI thought that was a Magic record. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø[deleted]That three year stretch by Elgin though is wacky 35/17/5 on .438 shooting. He is only like .002 points off of two mvp candidates this season, harden and pg13 both shoot a .440 this season on 25 and 20 shots respectively.   Those older years they also shot a lot more since pace was so rapid, they shot on average like 105 times a game as opposed to the 89 for the 2018-19 season. In addition to that the average fg% was also about .020 lower compared to what it is now. Elgin at the time was basically straight up league average, while those other two from a pure fg% standpoint are a good hunk below par, while taking less shots. I am aware though that their efg and ts% are above league average just because of the factoring in of ft/3pt.  All I'm saying at the end of the day is that you for sure wanted Elgin Baylor doing what he did back in the day on your team, the man is undoubtedly one of the 10 best pure scorers in NBA history and also one of the most important player in NBA history for how he changed the view on black players at the time. Him and wilt made it okay to be black and score the ball, before them all the dominant scorers were white and black people were expected to fill a role similar to Bill Russells.The only clear stat pad was keeping him in for that extra like 40 seconds and his defensive rebound which wasn‚Äôt even that bad. His other rebound was offensive Westbrook could never be in the background, he can bully his way into any game with a healthy mixture of determination and athleticism. Rondo was like a maestro at his best. You could always be cogniscent of the good plays rondo is making, but never realize he is closing in on 8-15-15. in that case would he average a triple double for the season? I don't have excel on this laptopNow is not the time to reasonable my brother. He could easily average 30/18/18Most things Westbrook is doing seem unreasonable rnrebounds would be easy getting 5 other thunder players to hit a shot from outside is going to be the hard part. hopefully presti does magic If he chased the 15 assists a game record with the same vigor as he did the triple double record I think he can get it. But 15 rebounds seem out of reach for his size. The amount of shots in a game has gone up and continues too. It is quite possible. [For those who missed it, here's some context on what he meant to the culture of the NBA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b7urqo/nba_players_offer_respect_and_prayers_for_rapper/)[Looks like they were handing out food together somewhere and giving back to the community together. Lighting is a bit weird so idk if it's real.](https://i.redd.it/aeb3b6wzsyp21.jpg)kawhi tooKills me that Beard's in so many people's photos with Nip man...saw Demar's, Odell's sticks out in my mind too, I'm sure there's others...wish there was more we could do for him rnI'm from the UK but was he from a rough part of Califonia or something   I think non American people like myself often have a obscured view of Califonia and see it as this amazing city full of rich areas because of the whole LA thing it's surprising to read that Cali actually has some rough parts that includes gang violence.Could see him holding back the tears half way through He has a pretty niche style of rap in my opinion but you could pretty much find him on the playlist of any LA NBA player like Harden, Westbrook, DeRozan or Kawhi.  But the reason why he was important was because he came from the hood and went back to try to make it a better place.  It's like what LeBron is doing for Akron in some sense. I don't want to compare the magnitude of both but it's like that.Me neither, apparently he's huge in the LA scene tho so it makes sense that the LA guys feel a connection to himHe was your favorite rapper‚Äôs favorite rapper, basically. Well known and respected in the hip-hop community, but not mainstream himself.You probably never heard of him if your not a fan of West Coast hip hop. Is no one going to call out how fucking dumb it is for Westbrook to shout out a crip set after the guy got gunned down in broad daylight in his hometown? It isn't adorable or heartfelt, its just dumb and reinforces all of the same things that led to his friend's murder.  Edit: To prevent further inundation of my inbox: I don't give a shit about the particulars of the murder. I don't give a shit about some glamorous connotation that "sets" have taken on. I don't watch Gangland. I went to a public school in a large city and have plenty of friends of all different backgrounds. We need less tribalism in the world, not more. Save your breath.Feels like everyone on here is like that focus group for crip-a-colayeah im with you. how is shouting out the gang number supposed to be honorable lol  its different from honoring the dude himself for his positive actionsBecause r/nba never grew out of the pasty-white-kid-who-thinks-worshipping-gangsters-makes-him-cool phase.More like remembering where you came from, dude. It's not. Nipsey's identity is being homaged, because that's how we remember dead people we loved. His crew was part of who he was.He *averaged* 48.5 minutes per game that year. The game didn't look nearly as intense as it does nowI think that the amount of dribbles you could take after receiving a pass were less for it to count as an assist so yeahThis made me blow air out my noseMilkwomen FBI open upIS THIS THE ROLE MODEL YOU WANT FOR THE KIDS???Absolutely. This sub tears down a lot of achievements, especially when it comes to Russ and the stat padder labelDont give him too much credit, Colin Cowherd is not a professional.It‚Äôs 100% a joke my guy lolHe was only short on assists coming into this game, and he almost got all of them he needed(like 24 over 3 games or something) tonight. He's got 3rd trip dub season just about locked up.[deleted]Well you got freaking West now so you'll be with us soon. I can bet he can mix and match atleast to make team like nuggets.dear godThis belongs in the Met or the LouvreThe meme god...giveth...?Quick wake up, that was almost 60 years ago. Everyone on this sub wants players to play like they did in the 80s until someone actually doesHe's like Iverson to me. You have to take the bad games with the good games, but they're box office, have a huge will to win, and will be remembered long after they're out of the league*screened*Lol dude its so dumb but it‚Äôs actually parroted here every time he has a bad game. A lot of irrational Russ haters hide until he loses; that‚Äôs when these herds of memelords copy paste that dumbass theory and seriously believe it. It‚Äôs a cycle that never ends It‚Äôs literally been said multiple times. It‚Äôs insane lmaoDude has been selfishly padding his assist stats for a few years now.I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more than thatI can admit I was a hater. Saw him live and changed my tune. Dude is one of the greatest the game has right now. He deserves respect.He literally averaged 48.5 min/game one season in a game that only lasts 48 minutes. Why he's not in the GOAT conversation more is beyond me.ok^thanksLast time LeBron didn't make playoffs THE THUNDER DIDNT EXISTHaha. Ditto.Thanks mate! Corrected. Good catchYou will never get perfection out of Russ, but you will get excellence What happened? I cant be crazy, he wasn't always a bad 3 shooter.....I mean attacking the rim Russ is the best Russ but I do remember him being a relatively trustable line drive three point shooterPFFT. You think this is unique to /r/nba this is just any game of any type. Sports, video games. Etc.   &#x200B;  A dude could be the best player ever and as soon as they have a single game where they don't perform "washed up" "why dont they replace him" blahblahblah. People never shut up with their fucking 0 IQ analysis.That‚Äôs just fucking insane. He actually did get 25 that season too. Nuckin futs I ran into him at the grocery store....do NOT get me started on it.Oh! You're right. I thought it was 11 for some reason. John Lucas had 14 in a quarter in 1984 too it seems.  My apologiesWoahHarden is tsunade, brute forcing shit  Westie is jiraiya. Goofy but balanced.  Durant is basically orochimaru cause he a snake. Lmao gotemm  Edit: i know its cliche but ive been a redditor for 4 years and have never been gilded, Thank you!!!Durant inherited blowing a 3-1 lead in the conference finals then bailing to create a superteamNews Headline from tomorrow - *Westbrook to sit out the next several games due to extreme dehydration. Cause unknown at this time.*I think we need a ruling on what sleeping with a women is.  Do you have to finish or could 1000 women line up go at it for 5 seconds then next one comes in. You could knock out a whole bunch that way quicker. Yes, it‚Äôs a chucking stat. Sarcasm and all that. Crazy how they used to let that happen to that degree.   If rookie Shaq came in and started jacking 30+ shots a night and can‚Äôt even break 50% on the field, he‚Äôd get cussed out, get benched, and get called a knucklehead for the rest of his career.It would be really close. Can we get Ja to weigh in on this? 101/56/31 who says no18 assists... not with the way OKC have been shooting. But if anyone can it's himTHUNDER GOIN ALL THE WAY THIS YEAR BABY!!!!!!! THE WAVING WHEAT CAN SURE SMELL SWEET WHEN THE BRODIE FINALLY GETS A RING!!!!!!! OOOOOOOO-GO CRY TO YOUR SCARJO SHRINE KD!!!!!!!!!That's what I mean, maybe someone could break the 15 assist threshold, but the players that can are almost guaranteed to not be able to break the 15 rebound threshold at the same time, or vice versa.[Not true at all.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html). This season barely rates in the top 30 in FGA all time, and only just in the top 20 all time in assists. Thanks! I'm a broke boy right now but this sort of thing deserves more than an upvote. I've listened to nipsie for years (honestly a lot of features) but the response to his death has been amazing.  None of us want to die but if some day I could affect a quarter of the people half of the way he did I'd feel like I did life right.It is real. Here's one from the Getty https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/russell-westbrook-and-rapper-nipsey-hussle-serve-thanksgiving-dinner-picture-id625015964?s=612x612Yup. They even did a Foot Locker commercial together.   https://youtu.be/KX4Fbw-2nWsman, someone linked this [TMZ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3GoaSeHZrU) of them together   never seen Harden so happyLA in the 80s and 90s was probably one of the most, if not the most, dangerous cities in America. While it‚Äôs a lot better than back then now a days it‚Äôs still very dangerous if you wander around the wrong parts. Even Oakland isn‚Äôt a place you want to wander in the wrong place in. So yea, in short, he was. He became an entrepreneur and instead of moving away he wanted to build up his neighborhood to give children a safer place and more opportunities then they usually get. yea, he‚Äôs from south LA. South LA is way better today than the 90s, but still suffers from a lot of poverty, and some crime and gang violence. Same part of LA as NWA and the Game[A lot of kids could learn a thing or two from how this dude's mind worked.](https://twitter.com/jasonjermaine/status/1112516979150278656)A reason a lot of people haven't heard of him is because he stayed independent as long as he could. He could have stayed with a major, but he decided he wanted to build his own brand and hold on to his own IP rights.  If Nipsey had signed, more people would have known about him 10 years ago. Dude was a legend in Los Angeles for years.Kind of like Fabolous for NY ballersFor real. Fuck people saying he was a gangster and had it coming. Pretty god damn sad if a man who grew up in such tough and dark environments who made a name for himself and was lifting his people up while constantly himself trying grow "had it coming." He did not deserve to be gunned down. The message he leaves behind is ultimately a positive one regardless of the troubling reality that he grew up in and presented through his art. He had a track or two that broke through and seemed poised to break out. He had started to get more recognition after that Grammy nomination it seemed.   Not that any of that matters, and he certainly wasn‚Äôt seeking it out. He was dedicated to using whatever platform he did have to improve his community and was doing an incredible job of that. I'm pretty sure it was determined by the investigation that the murder wasn't gang relatedNipsey got killed by someone in the same neighborhood as himself, so it's not like Westbrook faces getting killed by a rival gang.  People already know where Westbrook is from, and even when you don't gang bang, you will be associated with your 'hood'.  That's how LA works anyway. It's not right, it's not 'cool', but that's how it is.except he didn't get shot because he was in a gang. He got shot because of someone he knew that was jealous of him.Nipsey wasn‚Äôt killed because of his gang affiliations so it hardly matters. If you ignore that he was murdered by a dude he kicked out of his store then your comment makes perfect dense. People still like to romanticize the gang culture. if their parents had fled the southern and eastern portions of LA back in the 90s for a better life they would understand. Because gang shit is more than just criminal shit. His positive actions were not mutually exclusive from his affiliations. The history of gangs in cities like LA and Chicago is more complex than people selling drugs and shooting each other. Wilt averaged 1.01 games per game that season. I just don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs possible. Like, was he expected to only give 75% on all of his minutes, or did he just have stamina the likes of which will never be seen again, or did the game just move at a much slower pace?no dribbles or pumpfakesAll 20,000 of themMilkchildrengod damnit. I Rip van winkled*Teleports behind you*  Nothing personel, kid‚ÄúSmh Russ only passes when he knows he‚Äôll get the assist‚Äù     ‚ÄúSo he looks for shots likely to go in?‚Äù     ‚ÄúYou obviously don‚Äôt watch basketball you idiot, go worship that reporterist prick‚ÄùBout damn near 85% of the sub lol. Just wait till his next bad game and everyone‚Äôs gonna forget about thisBecause his teams were dominated by his rival‚Äôs team pretty much his entire career.üôÑüôÑüôÑ this has been hashed out a million times. Dude was *obsessed* with statistics, wasn‚Äôt even considered a top 2 player by other NBA players playing at the timeThat's some hilarious Chuck Norris bullshitOh my godMan this drove it home for me. I feel conflictedWell said.Dude, I love this.Upvote for giving me a work-friendly cuss word.Haha don't worry about it I was just being sarcastic.  The only reason I know is because I made a post about this record a while back.Fucking have my upvote you goddamn dirty weeb Jesus chist the durant part got me unpreparedüòÇbravo.I am honoredThis comment itself pushed my poop out. ^^ThxTo be fair to wilt. Fg% league wide was much lower when he played. He was still one of the league leaders those years he was sub 50% on 30+ shots.  With context he goes from looking like a chucker to looking like an efficient volume scorer. How about that. Well there's no way you can take 30 good shots in a game, so shooting less than 50% with that high of a volume is almost a guaranteeWHERE IS JA?!?!?These will be his shooting splits next seasonIs that a stat line or the new Kingdom Hearts titleWestbrook, Westbroook, 12 stories high, made of radiation. I think prime Lebron with Westbrook mentality could have done it.I got you fam!Beautiful! I honestly only started listening to his stuff when I learned his album was up for album of the year, but seriously learning how the dude contributed to his community makes me respect him more than anyone else. Let‚Äôs hope others step up and fill in his shoes everywhereAh good to see this. The lighting in /u/dailycrossover 's post look so off I can't help but think it's shopped.Off topic and I mean no disrespect here, but damn that commercial showed me more about Kawhi‚Äôs personality than everything I've gathered up to this point in my lifeBro Harden ran over to him like he was a step back 3 shit that hit me so hard They went to middle school together and I know Nipsey was heavy into ball before he started banging so they probably played together. Childhood friends that both made it.People rag on Oakland too much.  I lived in East Oakland near High Street, about a 20 minute walk from Fruitvale Station for 2 years and never had a problem, even when walking home after midnight.  Spent 3 days in Philadelphia and in that period of time I had an incident where three guys tried to steal my phone at gunpoint.He's speaking some real truth in this and may Nipsey RIP but dam bruh why the fuck are they zooming in on his forehead like that lmao Awesome video, but r/killthecameraman Exactly this, as a new college graduate fully prepared to live a life of being a corporate drone, Nipsey's choice to bet on himself AND IT WORKING was inspirational to me. Yet here I am drinking and smoking and all I can do is remember now.Became a Grammy nominated artist. All independent. That shit boggles my mind. Hustled for so long and he really became Grammy nominated. Legend. Also, because he owns his own masters, all the money from his album sales/streams, which has exponentially increased in the last few days, will go to his family. Very good comparison although I'm not sure what Fab does for NYC. Sounds like the Mac Dre of LA. I'm not into hip hop, but Mac Dre is still huge in the Bay Area even though he's been gone for a while now. Meanwhile people outside of the Bay have hardly heard of the dude. Wait what?  Did they catch the guy already?How is no one understanding that it‚Äôs not the gang affiliation with nipsey but the gang affiliation with murder/drive bys?   Nipsey might not have been killed because of his gang affiliation but gang affiliation gets a lot of people killed in similar circumstances.   It‚Äôs dumb as fuck to promote a culture of crime after a tragic crime just took place. That‚Äôs the point of his comment, which was apparently so badly missed. Tons of people romanticize where they grew up. More complex, sure, but overall gangs are a thorn in society‚Äôs ass. >stamina the likes of which will never be seen again  He did claim to sleep with 20k women. So based on pure speculation, yes. I‚Äôm just going off the top of my head but most top guys in the 60s played around 45mpg give or take. It‚Äôs still hugely impressive to average over 48mpg but it wasn‚Äôt some huge outlier, if that makes sense? Also there were more possessions per game compared to how, but imo players of today do a lot more running per possession.Aw shit man I'm sorry. It's 2019. Its a nightmare. I'm gonna rip van winkle myself. If you're awake, wake me up in a few years... Or as long as it takes. To be fair, everybody was dominated by the Celtics then. I see it as, if he‚Äôs good enough to *decide* to just lead the league in assists, and put up 50 PPG, and all his records, he should be up there anyway. That just sounds like players being real salty that he was balling out like he was playing with children. Lmao thats straight up bullshit tho..Everyone other than Russell was scared shitless of Wilt and knew he was better than themThe Durant part made my night Are you prepared now?Wilt took over 30 a game and shot 49.9% or better 4 timesJokes aside, imagine someone shooting 56% from deep and 31% at the line.hm...Dang u right. They went to middle school together even though they're 4 years apart ?Three guys... Gun.... Tried. Please tell this storyWow, I‚Äôve never had to deal with anything like that, how‚Äôd it all go down?Yea, I grew up around Philly and have spent the better part of my adult life on the west coast.  I chuckle when people tell me to stay away from "rough neighborhoods" out here.    That said, these days Philly is generally pretty safe as long as you stay central.   Curious when it happened and where you were when this went down.  Robberies like this were way more common ten years ago.Lmao bruh and he standing there addressing the shit out of that camera 5HeadSo be inspired and do more. Do your drone thing and get your money and be comfortable but keep that hustle in the back of your mind and do something bigger on the side that makes you even happier. I am trying to do the same myself. I know thats vague, but thats all us more normal dudes can do, look at someone like that and realize we can at least make a little more time on the side to do something more. Besides rob ball players?Down in good old Bakersfield, we'd listen to Mac all the time growing up. I'm talking mid 2000s to late. So I think more people have listened to him than you would think outside of the bay. YesIf he slept with 20k women, that means he got a lot of sleep so he pretty much always had plenty of energy54.8 years, or 18.2 years if he got triple teamed every night.Players were more salty at the team actually beating them for championships Do you have to take free throws right at the line, or can you stand further back? So could this hypothetical player just take all his free throws from the top of the arc instead?No joke in 2003 Bruce Bowen led the league in 3P% (44.1%) but also had the worst FT% (40.4%) in the league. Not as crazy as 56 and 31 but still kinda wild.If Shaq and Steph had a baby ...It could happen. Ha!In 2002-03, Bruce Bowen shot 44.1% on 3-pointers, and 40.4% on free throws.I don‚Äôt know how much detail you want, but the short version is: they decided to give me my phone back after I beat the shit out of the guy with the gun.  The longer version is embarrassing because I was an idiot.  Before it happened I was walking down the street and browsing on my phone with no idea anything bad was going to happen.  I‚Äôd been bar hopping solo that night so I won‚Äôt pretend I was sober.  But anyways, it was a pretty well-coordinated effort on their part.  I was on the right side of the street, about a block east of Broad.  Without me noticing, one guy drove up the street from behind while the other two came up from behind me on foot.  The guy with the gun hit me in the back of the head with it as the other guy grabbed my phone.  The SUV passed us and the two guys hopped in‚Äîthe guy with my phone got in the front passenger seat while the guy with the gun (which, since I was unphased by the hit, I now assume was plastic) slid in the back.  Not really thinking but definitely pissed, I immediately followed the guy with the gun into the back seat (I hadn‚Äôt yet figured out what he was holding, and in my defense it was likely fake anyways).  I told them to give me my phone back, which is when the guy with me in the back seat pointed the gun at me.  Once again not thinking, I throat-punched him four or five times, so when I told the other two to give me my phone back, they did.  I do realize, in retrospect, that I was lucky to be able to overwhelm them with sheer stupidity, and that next time I should just give up the phone.Well LA being safer than Philly was the basis of the beloved Fresh Prince of Bel Air.Man you got it, I came off a little depressed (and I am) in general but I ain't lost, if Nip taught me anything its to get yours cuz no one's giving it to you. Working on my own multiple streams they ain't here yet but they're coming, I'm hoping the same for everyone that's paying attention. Salute to you.*supposedly* he would have orgys with 15-20 women extremely frequently, but still those numbers are probably inflated You can take it anywhere in the circleWilt used to stand far behind the line because he was apparently too strong to take it from the regular distance, and it hurt his accuracy. That's what I heard at least.I don't want to say this sounds like bullshit because you might throat punch me. So I won't. Yikes man, ya I'd say you were pretty lucky there.  Glad you made it out alive.> Once again not thinking, I throat-punched him four or five times, so when I told the other two to give me my phone back, they did.  I don't know what is funnier: you typing this story thinking it is believable or the fact that a few dummies appear to have been fooled  They coordinated a 3 man attack to get your phone, but then weren't able to drive off? Ok.
r/nhl, Jesus, you just walked on water!  Yeah dude, it's frozen.I'm sure Jesus will be watching the Superbowl^TM while drinking ice cold Bud Light^TM eating Papa John's Pizza^TM and taking his Viagra^TMOf course he'd be watching hockey!

r/nhl, Ouch  r/leafsEasily could‚Äôve been a Caps meme EXCEPT NOT ANYMOREGosh this is a perfect meme!BEST ONE HOLY SHIT AHAHAHAHA Oof ouch owie my leafy bones By far the best meme yet.Same reason why Avs fans got so spoiled. First year in Denver (transfer, not expansion, obviously)..."Oh neat, a Stanley Cup!"/chefkissesfingers  Outstanding, bravoAs a Caps fan, casually go fuck yourself   /sToo goodLol this is great The funny thing about this is, Seattle is going to have such high expectations after their draft but I can see them being more of an Atlanta thrashers rather than Vegas. Out of the loop This is the bestLol r/lawschooladmissions crossover?Also applies to Winnipeg YEAH.    yeahr/leafs r/jets r/sabres r/hurricanes r/panthers This got me right in the buds. It's called the snap and pop... works every time.   Edit: *Bend and snap. Its and old movie. My memory is not that good. Help us Ovie-Ben-Kenobi. You're our only hopeYou do realize the Leafs were in the playoffs this year right? And last year.[There's always next year!](https://giphy.com/gifs/boy-crying-interview-l3vQZ8ko4l0nvjm2Q)YES PLZSubscribe!They got in 1998, although they got swept.Pleeeeeeeeeease post this on r/hockey Stop drinking the Leaf hurting juiceSame as a Blues fan.‚Äò96 and ‚Äò01 feel like a very, very long time ago though. Oh God yes!! Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic, Peter Foresberg, Foote, Lemuix!!!! Fuck yeah we were spoiled!!!! we got some of the greatest people to play the game man!!!!üêßEspecially because the knights get to protect every single player. So the knights get to cherry pick a stacked team, and Seattle gets their sloppy seconds. Honestly, the new expansion rules are ridiculous.  I'm also sick and tired of hearing how it's a miracle they even made it into the playoffs. Kinda easy when just your goalie alone has won the cup not once, not twice, but three times.Legally Blonde... So so movie, absolutely fucking amazing musical.The Las Vegas Golden Knights, the Mascot on the bottom panel, made it to the Stanley cup finals on their first year.  As a side note: Seriously Golden Knights? Maybe this is just pent up anger from years of playing [Ghouls and Ghosts](http://donhodges.com/images/ghouls'n%20ghosts2.png) but Golden Knights? Were they just looking for what could possibly sum up the tacky, flashy but ultimately hollow nature of Vegas?What is this? A crossover episode?I don't think you understand how making fun of the leafs works You do realise it says "Finals", right?I think this goes to show how the concept of "Stanley cup FINALS" is so foreign to a Leafs fan. And if you read the picture it clearly says ‚ÄúStanley cup finals‚ÄùPretty sure that‚Äôs been the leafs motto for the past 51 year at this pointCan't post memes thereWe are spoiled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Tell me about itHeh that's interesting. Wouldn't have considered seeing the musical, even though the movie is such an easy watch. May have to reconsider!Personally I was hoping it'd be the Desert Knights instead, it fits better and has a double meaning.They couldn't have just been the Knights? They had to be the one team with an adjective, just to make everyone look inferior.Seen their pre-show on a few ESPN shows.......the tacky never seems to stop, it's like if the rejects from the renaissance fair tried to get a job at the restaurant from Cable Guy, couldn't even get a job at Excalibur, sitting in an ally in costume and some scummy guy came up and said "wanna be the mascot of a hockey team?!?"Oh I do. Just making light of the Canadian Curse continuing on another year.Leafs fans can't read Lol I do nowFunny how one word changes things.So it does At least you guys won one.  Way to rub it in.Why do they hate fun?That one would actually be a pretty good team name.To be fair, the leafs have Maple as their adjective, so the Knights aren't the only ones.Red Wings, Blue Jacketsdidn't they want to just be the knights but the OHL London knights got pissed?   https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/las-vegas-nhl-name-search-complicated-london-knights/That's why they're the "Leafs", not "Leaves".Well it wouldn't make much sense for a meme to be posted where a leafs fan (a team who's been eliminated for a while) is asking a Vegas fan (a team who's in the finals) if it's hard to make the playoffs (which started a month and a half ago) especially considering the Leafs have made the playoffs for the past two years. It's even weirder considering the finals start in a couple days. IdkHahaha, hey I know the feeling, I was a huge Atlanta fan so I‚Äôm used to losing. Gotta love that playoff curseBlues fan. Still waiting, 51 years later. If every sub allowed memes every sub would just be filled with memes. Nobody wants that.Capi tals.Obviously, you don't understand basic grammar.   "the rules surrounding the plural form of proper nouns (two Maple Leaf players are Maple Leafs for the same reason that Julia Child and family are the Childs and not the Children"  [Here's a book that might help you understand](https://www.amazon.com/The-Language-Instinct-Mind-Creates/dp/0060976519)That's why I was confused. Oh well. Guess I should be reading closer.At least you‚Äôre not a Washington fan. We be the choke kings False. I want that.That's fairBlack Hawks     Louis Blues     Red SoxYeah, but in my defense, Atlanta falcons at the Super Bowl was basically the definition of chokingGo Caps! I feel they are the sharks East. Great regular seasons followed by disappointment. Rooting for you guysWhoa whoa. My sharks would like to have a say in thatGo to a meme site thenVery true
r/nhl, This is the comic relief I neededWell technically... they did roll over. As an avalanche fan, I felt right at homeDid you guys hear about the premature baby elephant that was born in Pittsburgh last night? It's incredible how smart elephants are that they can be born early like that when they know that no Predators will show up in the city. This sub can sometimes pull gold out of its ass. Top shelf post. Accurate.  Way too accurate.Careful where you're poking with that stick, now.Even as a pens fan i wish they made it a better game tonight.  They didnt show up at all and it was an awful game to watch. Getting beat is doing stuff. This. People will say "Oh Rinne gave up all these goals, he got rekt" but only the first goal mattered. If our offense can't put the puck in the net then the goalie isn't why we lost. If they can't show up to play at Pittsburgh Public Library then all the catfish in Nashville can't help them. We knew going in we'd have to win at least one road game, I'd much have preferred Game 1 or 5 over Game 7 but it seems they're dead in the water at PPG.What was that about being all Murray's fault?White Ninja, that is a spicy meme my friend.Can't even be mad. Total accurate. Never seen any team I follow so completely fail to show up for a game. Unbelievable. Props to the Pens, but still, it's like the Preds never got off the bus.I mean congratulations to the Penguins, but how a team who dominated in the last two games (5-1, 4-1) could experience such a breakdown? Rinne's fault? The defensive's fault? Fan support in the building is much more important in this series?I don't get it. Why is a penis poking the Preds logo?Nah. Go Pens!ThisWhy bother when I can bet on the over line of 5.5 goals, and Pittsburgh will still cover by themselves. Let's Go Pens!Felt the same way when the pens were in Nashville As a pens fan, i like this.How I feel about my Jacksonville Jaguars every Sundayi loldDude, they better wake up. Haha honestly one of the funniest things I've seen on Reddit today. Thanks OP!u/calmerthanudude[deleted]RawrOuchHaha - well played sir.  On a serious note, that's a hard trick to learn...so there's that...Thank god they were laying down on that ice last night, they'll need all of it for that burn.As a Red Wings fan, I still don't like you. as a Ducks fan, you guys do know you can get flair that lets people know who you are a fan of right?[deleted]Well done. That was a very labor-intensive setup.It was probably rebounded which they led to a odd man rush on the other end.  This meme circulates almost every playoff season when someone's team starts looking bad. Always appropriate, though.Yeah it might go right past RinneThere is absolutely no way you are a Pens fan if you didn't enjoy watching that game.i had a great time watching that that ass kicking> Even as a pens fan  I don't believe you.Weird cause they showed up game one more than the Pens and still lost.  It seems to be going back and forth a lot.I am with you, I never enjoyed blow outs. I want a hard fought game from the first "whistle" to the lastThis is the first game I have turned off this post season.  I have no skin in the game but god damn that was a turrible game.The blatant favoritism by the refs and NBC kind of makes that hard.Getting laid out.Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh... and it's awesomeHave you ever been to a game at Consol/PPG paints? It is deafeningly loud during the regular season let alone in the post season. I mean it was built much better than Mellon so you don't get the top seat overhangs swinging but it is just as loud as Mellon.  Also. You ever notice when a team is complete garbage and has no chance sports writers always talk about how loud it is, or how creative the fans are? Awww look at them with their silly chants and blatant ripoff of the Red Wings by throwing a cat fish on the ice.  And look at the celebrities! So many cool celebrities like Nichole Kidman. Jesus you guys should be embarrassed by that shit.Lol "Pittsburgh public library." Creative I guess, but there's more to hockey than a canned goalie taunting cheer that you break out even when the goalie wasn't in the net So this is just a wild guess but Nashville fans are loud. I mean *reallllll loud*. Penguins obviously were having some crazy problems even connecting passes and I believe it's because they couldn't even hear the pass being made. If they weren't turned around looking for the puck it flew past them all the time.Their defense takes way too many chances.  They leaned heavily on their goalie in Nashville.  They could have easily lost that game if The Pens were able to finish on their chances.  The way their defense plays requires top notch goal tending.  Did you actually watch the last game or just see the score?  The Preds absolutely did not dominate Game 4.  The Pens won the high-danger chances 17-11.  That was the most high-danger chances the Pens had since the CBJ series.  Matt Murray was only average.  Pekka Rinne stole that game.  He didn't steal this one.The Preds got an ass whooping last night. And that's putting it lightly.Hell yeah.Hell yeah. We got thisNah, they should just do what they did again.Yep. That's your OCYeah man!  Plus Saber-tooth Tigers can't even play hockey!  What a stupid fictional character for a sports team!  They should be the Nashville Ice Hockey Players.  True, but maybe their efforts would be more well spent on scoring?As a Leafs fan, thanks for your coaching staff.As an Avs fan, I always have something negative to say about anyone in Red Wings gear.  That hatred won't go away.As a different Avalanche fan, I don't like you.Pound sandNo one likes a tattle tail. It's also based on factSavageHome Rinne has been clutch all playoffs long.  Away Rinne has been decent, and Pittsburgh Rinne has been awful.    We should be able to win game 6, and pray to God Rinne wakes up when the Cup is on the line.Might?Pekka Achoo.  Im not just a pens fan im a hockey fan and just enjoy watching a great game.  Even if its your team winning its just hard to get into the game and it loses that intensity the sport gives you. Me 2. 6 rounds on me. And I cannot be happier.I was born and raised in Pittsburgh and have been living in Nashville for the last 2 years, I've been to plenty of games in both. We Pens fans have nothing to feel insecure about, so let's stop getting but they about how everyone talks about the Preds fans. We get plenty loud and rowdy. I'd go to a game at Consol over Bridgestone any day because the Pens are my team.  But Nashville's done a great fuckin job making those games fun as hell and getting the crowd into it. It's a city built on the entertainment industry with zero historical hockey culture. I think it's stupid to try to knock them for doing that.    I could do without the catfish.   Go PensAnd let's wave a yellow towel while we're at it - no one does that right?Complete garbage? Lol. It was tied two days ago bud. All those celebrities live here and are fansTechnically, it still is his fault that the net is empty..If you're an experienced hockey player, you ALWAYS know where the puck is.  The passes were not anywhere close to where they could be received. Defensively the preds once again left the center of the ice wide open, allowing the pens to set up shop in front of and around the net all night.  They pretty much played the worst hockey they have played all series long.  I was shocked.  The score got away from them so quickly that there was nothing but frustration for most of the game.  I think the refs did call it a bit one-sided, but it's not the reason the preds lost.    Crowd noise does affect communication out there, but aside from taking away the ability to make a no-look pass, and urging a referee to make a call when the crowd sees something they don't like, it should not affect the outcome of the game.  The Predators were mentally checked out.[deleted]I think it's actually the ice itself.  In Nashville, the ice is slushy and slows down the Penguins' attack and changes the movement of the puck.  For me, it wouldn't matter, I can't pass a puck to save my life.  For pro players, millimeters count (for the passer).  If he expects it to go straight and it starts off a millimeter slower off the blade of his stick, it'll be right (right handed passer) of the target by a margin that the recipient can't handle.  In Pittsburgh, the ice is more suited to the Pens' style of play - fast skating, crisp passing, etcetera.  That makes a lot of sense. I think the Pens are more skillful, but the Preds are the faster team. They got in their own way at times and the Pens made them pay for it. I also don't think that first holding call would have been made if the fans didn't throw a catfish on the ice. This sounds so much like a description of Dan Bylsma's Penguins.They must simultaneously score more goals and stop the other team from scoring more goals.Phil kessel is Stanley Cup champion.As a Flyers fan, I am quietly crying whole holding onto our second round draft pick like a security blanket. It only hurts when we think about it. Lol y'all are over paying for that coaching staff.As a wings fan living in Denver, I miss the rivalry, there's nothing like it around in modern sportsThat one was way over your head.Not to mention, the only reason it's remotely loud in the regular season is because of the PA system telling the fans when to make noise. If that's not blaring some shit, the fans sit there quiet as a field mouse.Again. Complete garbage bud. Valid I was blown away by that power play when the Preds couldn't even get it off the damn boards. AstoundingThere are a lot of hockey fans at the PGA tour and a lot of hockey players.  What else are we gonna do without a team in the playoffs?  Also, [wait until about 1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpwVIVXq1w) if you want to see rowdy golf fans.  These guys will boo bad shots and go ape shit crazy for good ones.Why would the ice inside an arena be different from any other?+1 for ice quality.    Ice seems harder in Pittsburgh, and not only do more passes connect, but the Pens seem to hold better edges in Pittsburgh than the Preds.  Of course he is, he went to Pittsburgh.As a Thrasher fan, at least you have draft picks. We can afford it.Ah the glory days of the Red Wings and Avs rivalry, I still have newspaper clippings laying around from some of the more memorable games.doot doot dootSECTION | CONTENT :--|:-- Title | Francesco Molinari‚Äôs hole-in-one on No. 16 at Waste Management Description | In the third round of the 2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open, Francesco Molinari cards an ace on the par-3 16th hole. .

Forget technicalities in law ... but facts need to be said and proven   otherwise what is going to stop me from alleging rape and ruining lives of many people without backing it up with a consistent story or proof from rape kits and all that stuff that goes with this kind of stuff..  I work in the fucking criminal courts, so i know my ass from my elbow, but on reddit, that means nothing. true, but before any conviction or before any trial one cant portray him as a RAPIST   and yes the damage is done, even if he is found without fault and found fully not guilty without a cavet attached to it.   There are many cases where when found guilty , the person didnt do anything wrong ... but there are others where there is not enough threshold evidence to prove if and how it was done, leaving doubt ..... but that is not majority of cases.what obsure show is that from?Right right, because of the implication.No, Dennis is the GOLDEN GOD!Oh shit! Guess I'm gonna stop using Hola. Thanks for letting me know. This is your awakening, Dejaentendu93. Seize it.Just wanted to say love the username.

r/nhl, His name is K√∂ksal Baba and he drives a Mercedes.  https://youtu.be/SrsmQpMX5bg?t=114It took about 3 times watching that clip to figure out what was going on. And I am still not sure what happened.How this doesn't have 1000's of upvotes, I do not know.  Watched it 5 times, enjoyed each thoroughly.

I hate Marchand SO much... and its not one of those "but you'd love him if he were on your team" .. I would be downright pissed if that guy EVER wore the winged wheelWait...WHAT?!Holy shit I thought that was actually some little kid.HA!   I thought Marchy was the guy in the hat, and he was being "beaten up" by his nephew or something.   Then I saw the nose.   And it all made sense. My sides üòÇüòÇüòÇHoly fuck that is some good shit.  Bruins fan here. Ain't even mad lol.As a Bruins fan, this is still hilarious.   Is that H. Jon Benjamin trying to hold him back?Geez you could grate cheese off the bridge of his nose.  Oh Brad, you dishonor NS soDon't watch hockey but just looked this guy up, he even looks like a douchebag I guess you could say he has a short temper. Holy hell. I watched it 3x thinking "haha that little dude is kicking marchys ass I wonder what he did to deserve that hehe" and then I noticed the little dudes nose and though "hey looks like Marchy as well." Then I sat here and realized, followed by a mean cackle because a) I'm a fucking idiot & b) this is fucking hilarious.

Lol top 2nd post of /r/NHLHe's one of those guys who gets away with it because of the novelty of it. Until the day comes he does it to a guy who just doesn't give a shit, and he gets thrown out a window.I thought someone edited Marchand's head onto the little guy.

You turtle and you look like a bitch, you fight back and you are the giant asshole who beat up a child-sized man. That little dude is drunk as shit. I bet he had at least half a beer.

He hates you, too.It's easy to say things like that, but there's a reason why Boston fans love Marchand and it's not just because we're a bunch of assholes. I seriously believe that if Marchand had gone to any other team, he would be loved there.I think I hate Marchand more than I hate the winged wheel. The guy really is scum. It's too bad, because he's a decent player. But yah, fuck him and fuck anyone who likes him.So did I, at first/threadIt took me until I saw the nose, hahahaIt's quite alright, he hates you too.Someone posted his name in this thread, he's a very angry Russian small-person.

Hes like 5'7and you think that little thing with the yellow straw is Marchand?As a short dude that is the worst!I've always thought of him as a "love to have him, hate to play against him as well."

No wonder Bruins fans have a physicality complex. Their guys never get beat up according to the announcers.[deleted]You were chirping them for not having flair.5'9" there means 5'6" irl.What? Do you think I like that about Marchand? It's bullshit... and anybody that defends stuff like that coming from a player on their team or a different one is an idiot.Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistakes years ago but on, you know, a planetary scale.A blind man walks into a bar. And a table. And a chair.What the fuck are you watching? Josi slams Marchand in the back of the head while he's on the ice and Marchand gives it back to him. It's called hockey. No one was right or wrong in that exchange. It's part of the game. Marchand's size has nothing to do with it. Josi whacking him in the back of head is what prompted Marchand's defensiveness. I love Marchy, and I'm fine with what both players did here. You're just a biased crybaby. No it doesn'tA dyslexic man walks into a bra.A blind man pisses into the wind, "ahh yes, it's all coming back to me now".A neutron walks into a bar and asks "how much for a beer?"

r/nhl, Real talk here, I'm glad chokers are coming back into style.They were down 3-1 and forced a game seven. Choking would be the last word I would use to describe the Caps.  It was a great series.  Great puckin' hockey if you ask me.They were beaten by an incredible effort by each player on the Pittsburgh bench. No choking at all.I can't call this a choke on their part.  I felt like The Caps were the better team this series but Fleury stood on his head.r/shitpostIf you're really trying to manipulate Google's search results‚Äã (which r/prequelmemes already found out won't work for long) the term you want the image to show up for ("Washington Capitals") has to be the first words in the title.Can we please not stoop down to this level of shitposting?I have that exact necklace :PI don't think that's how Google works...I'm a Pens fan, but I like the Caps too.   With the playoff record both teams have, choking was a possibility for either. My original prediction‚Äã was Crosby gets injured, Pens choke, Caps win. But I thought both teams had a solid chance of choking leading to a 0-0 OT 1 goal game 7.   Fleury was on point last night, although a couple of those saves we're pure luck. Not a choke moment at all. There is a reason there are 7 games.  Yes. Finally, it's someone else!Meh. I wouldn't call it a choke.Dont know about the caps but A choker and a ball gag should reflect Toronto #FuckTheLeafsNot there yet, but [this](https://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/caps-holiday-card.jpg) isYou're in idiot.Fittingfeelsbadman Holy shit I just saw how many upvotes this got nowSavage.If you want to talk about a real choker then it's the sharks. Last year was the first year ever they got at far as they did. Don't get mad at me. Sharks have been my favorite team since I got into hockey in 2007. [Better](http://imgur.com/X8eodmr?)I don't like the light pressure against my neck and plus they get stuck in my beard.Good ol' blowjob blackbelts.Big picture though, the Presidents trophy winner failing to make it out of the second round is not a good look. It happens, but when you haven't made it to the Conference Finals in 12 years that's beyond comprehension.Agreed. Last year, and the several years before this were almost all chokes. We played our hearts out to force a game 7, I can't really be that mad. It was one hell of a series. They were on fire and they just couldn't pull it off in the end. As a Washington native, I am probably a bit biasedIsn't that what choking is, though? Failing to perform when it matters the most, like in a game 7? Idk.. when the same team takes you out 9 out of 10 times in the playoffs, even though you're the "better team"... I think that's the definition of choke.   Edit: "Better team" as determined by talking heads, the president's trophy, and all caps fans "THIS is our year!" posts.   It's not that I think they're the better team. Obviously they aren't. I almost feel bad for Washington.  They had an incredible team the last two years but the NHL changes the playoffs setup and they have to play the #2 team in the league in round 2 and lose back to back tight series.  You're telling me the better team lost? Bruce Boudreau is that you??Also, don't post a screenshot of a picture, holy shit OP is several levels of stupid. I agree with /u/PM-Your-Tiny-Tits.Can people please stop acting like the Google search algorithm hasn't been updated the last 3 years? :(NoSo you do anal? We have a black belt of dick sucking in our midstYou and so many others.But it isHow do you become a Pens fan that likes the Caps?How do you become a Pens fan that likes the Caps?They did go down 3-1 and failed to capitalize in a game where PIT was missing Crosby, soooo................Hey, Caps West... Pipe downthxYou're the mayor of salt town.[deleted]You're the guy with the dangling neck strap on the ice, huh? :)I totally agree.  Washington has demons.  Trotz and Ovechkin can't seem to get over the hump.  The future doesn't look bright because of contracts.  I was just happy not to see another 5-0 game seven.  I really felt they were going to push through, especially after the Crosby hit.Measuring the team by the round they lost in is misleading given the NHL's weird playoff format.  The Pens were the second best team in the east this year, and in any other league would have received the 3rd seed (Montreal would get the second seed as a division champion). So in a "normal" system the Pens would have beat the Caps in the 3rd round. Hey give us some credit, we haven't made it in 19 years. If you lose 9 times out of 10 you're not the "better team". I agree [deleted]I don't.  To be the best, you gotta beat the best.Yeah, same here. I think the playoffs should start with the top 16 teams seeded like a tennis tournament, with 1 playing 16, 2 playing 15 etc. Marketing is more important to the league and they think their system is better.To win the cup you have to beat the best teams. What does it matter of it was Pitts in round 2 or round 4?Nope.  Telling you that from what I saw The Caps played a more complete game more often and Fleury was the difference maker.  The shot totals for the series tell a story.Hard to argue with a redditor with that usernameI mean that goes without question, right?3rd degree black belt in meat slobbing to be exact According to redditoh okAlways liked the pens, but live in VA, so caps are pretty popular. Bravo sir, Bravo I don't even care about hockey. The choke meme is just old and tired.Great commercial./r/tumblrgifsShe sounds hideous. We will! She's a guy. The NHL format needs a serious rework. Washington should NOT play Pittsburgh in the second round. I don't like the format either, but it's only been in place since 2014. IMO the only times the Caps lost to a team that was clearly better than them in the Ovechkin era were when they lost to the Rangers in 2012 and 2015. Other than that they've had a stunningly bad run in winnable series.  This particular year wasn't as bad as others though, I'll give you that. The weird format makes it look worse.I agree with you... Presidents trophy and talking heads say otherwise though. Yeah like I said earlier.. I agree with you. I'm just parroting what the talking heads have been saying.   Perhaps my comment needs edited to make that clear, but fuck it, I'll wear those downvotes with pride. But also, I think presidents cup winners not advancing past the 2nd round is kind of a choke is it not?   More is expected of them, if they don't deliver, it's a choke.   I could care less either way I guess. Bottom line is they lost, as usual. To the pens, as usual. But shouldn't it be the best teams that make it to the final? If playoff structure means you are eliminating top teams in the second round, it's going to make for some shitty finals (theoretically).I'm fine with 1-8 in each conference. With unbalanced schedules between conferences it's really hard to do 1-16 without scraping conferences and that's not going to happenOnly problem with that is Vancouver vs Florida going back and forth for 7 GamesFor ratings at the very least, the drama should build That seems like a lazy justification to me. I get it, but if that's the case why even seed teams? Columbus finishes #3 in the east and is on the road at #2 in round 1. That doesn't reward either team for the 82 games they just playedA [f]act we have all learned from a few subs on herethen what are you doing on the sub.  did you come from r/all?r/shittytumblrgifs/The format is garbage, OTT & BOS should have played higher seed teams in the first round, yet we had CBJ playing PIT. And NYR had more wins & points yet did not get home ice in the 2nd rnd bc of how the format is set up. I could go on..As a Caps fan I definitely agree that they are underachievers. I just think "lost in the second round" is a terrible measure of it. Stanley Cup agrees with /u/L-Zilcho. That's the only thing that matters.Considering it could be an Ottawa / Nashville final, I believe that NBC would agree with you. Clearly they weren't the best team.....> Vancouver vs Florida  That is an issue. A conference 1 - 8 as suggested by  /r/crt134 might be better. It would vary by year but these guys aren't playing pro hockey for the air miles.Don't worry - a series against Ottawa will build the drama.  Get ready for... The SYSTEM! :DThat's what I meant to post. Didn't realize they were two different subs (very redundant). Nashville beat the "best" team in the West in round 1, so it's not quite the same argument. I won't try to defend my Sens. They had an easier bracket, plain and simple. But go Sens go!!I wanted Edmonton v Ottawa soooo badlyI said best teams, meaning top 2-4. If you have the best teams playing each other and the worst teams playing each other early in the playoffs, that means you'll have one of the best teams playing against one of the worst teams late in the playoffs. The games should be getting more competitive deeper into the playoffs.Yeah I mean it will by no means be an easy series. BUT for the purpose of building a more dramatic playoffs I feel like it probably should have been pens-rangers and caps-ottawa in the second round and then (theoretically) caps-pens in the finals. I could be wrong.Go Sens but by God they don't have all the weapons the penguins have. How the fuck do you beat Crosby Malkin Kessel with their backs against the wall? Three of the best players from three of the top hockey countries in the world. GLHFWould have been fun to watch the civil war. Clearly the caps weren't one of them. As they couldn't get there. Caps would still exit in the second round.  It's the laws of hockey physics, I guess.I just realized that we need a player whose last name starts with a "Y" so that Crosby, Malkin, the new Y guy, and Kessel could be the "CMYK" line.  Rust, Guentzel, and Bonino could then be the "RGB" line.  The "CMYK Line" would obviously be nonsensical, both because it would have four players (though perhaps one could be a backup in the event that one of CMK is injured, or maybe we replace Malkin with honorary rear-center and Stanley Cup Champion‚Ñ¢ Matt "Motherfucking" Murray) and because none of the current players on this hypothetical line are left wingers (though maybe the Y guy could be).  Either way, though, the result would be a quite colorful.Because they played another top team in an early round... That's the whole point. The better their record, the greater chance it'll happen.Not convinced on that, but could be. And they lost.   Everyone is held to the same standards, no?The last time that the Capitals went to the third round was 1997-98. They made it to the Stanley Cup Finals that season, only to be swept by the Red Wings dynasty.  So.. nearly 20 years.  Every year since, they've either not qualified, or were out in the first or second round.  In that same time, they finished 1st in their division 9 times.  I'm going to have to agree with the OP here.  Given their regular season success, the Caps haven't been able to match that level of success in the Postseason.  I'm not sure why.What? I'm just arguing that each series a team plays should be more difficult and competitive the deeper they go into the playoffs. If the first round has team Gretzky vs Team Orr and Team Shit vs Team Poop, that means you are going to end up with a very lopsided second round with Orr/Gretzky vs. Poop/Shit. My Buddy is a huge caps fan and he was born 1 week after the Caps got swept by the Wings. Maybe he is the bad luck as they haven't gone to the 3rd round since.

Lucky me I dont cheer for any team, just the finnish players in general so there is always someone to cheer for usually.This is the best thing about the playoffs. All the games are interesting to watch even if your team is not in.  I am just cheering for a Canadian team to win.

Can't argue that. But the living there? It's 98 percent garbage and the people moving there are retirees fighting off arthritis..I didn't say all... But most...It‚Äôs beautiful, nothing like the gulf breeze hitting your face walking your dog on Bayshore. The humidity in the summer is absolute ass I will concede that.98% is basically all.

Also I think Ohio‚Äôs 2 biggest claims are white trash trailer parks and a school thats so proud they can spell it became a national greeting for alumni  At least come with California or New York if you wanna be better. Ohio?  That‚Äôs just the Mississippi of the northWell yeah but the difference is you'd be wrong.. Florida is basically the warm version of how I view Montreal having traveled both places on business. Beautiful places with awful natives..
r/nhl, This is exactly me as a Brit watching any NHL game.Central Time here had to be up at 6am. Worth it.Bro when nhl games start its like midnight in Europe. So yeah thats me too watching from SloveniaI'm a Sharks fan. This is my life come playoff time  "Please win in regulation!! I have work tomorrow"Dude same here man, Sixers won big!  I was pumped.  Missed most of Islanders/Bruins, Dame hits that BAD shot  after a solid comeback.  I then get to watch SJ Vegas.  Wrap up it up with late night baseball and I can say April 23rd 2019 was an awesome night for sports.  Didn't see Raptors either but they had the score up in the Sixers game entire time.  &#x200B;  Phillies got destroyed though, but overall, wow what a random Tuesday night of April sports.Imagine that but living in Europe.this show sucks. fight me. bazinga.On the other hand, almost every game is a matinee when you live in Hawaii.I almost went to sleep halfway through the San Jose - Vegas game last night...almostI tolerate east coast bias in mainstream media because we get 4pm starts for the early games in exchange :)I was at the game and told my boss that I was physically and emotionally exhausted from the game and that I was taking the morning off. He was totally cool with it!This is me watching the games from Finland!Avalanche fan living in Cleveland, used to piss my mom off growing up so much yelling at the tv at 2am, used to send me to my grandfathers for the playoffs, even a live goal horn wouldn‚Äôt phase the guy while sleeping.I‚Äôm not even a big Vegas fan (I love Marc-Andre Fleury to death, but that‚Äôs it), but I got so emotionally invested in that game that I cried when they lost. tHeReS nOtHiNg LiKe PlAyOfF hOcKeYEast coast games start at 2am for me. West coast is around 5 am, so at least I can get a few hours in before the games.Well I live in the uk and I am up between 2am-6am most nights watching NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL each nightbazoingoI fell asleep on the couch in the second intermission...  I'm still upset about it.EXACTLY!!! New Englander here. I was in and out of sleep and missed the most exciting part of the 3rd period!This was me. Stayed up til 1:30 am and had classes & a presentation the next day. Don‚Äôt even know what I said in the presentation but staying up was worth it.This was me, a Torontonian, fan of the Bruins, living in Scotland...I'm on vacation in Ireland, had to stay up for Game 6 and 7 for my B'sThat was an amazing game.Sports viewing packages that make streaming and replays readily available (without showing scores first!) will revolutionize sports watching and will completely dismantle cable television. I can‚Äôt wait!   I watch all my hockey on Apple TV through the nbc sports app. They currently don‚Äôt let replays be viewable until at least 24 hours later or if at all. If they made streamable content immediately replayable then people could watch on their own time, first thing in the morning etc.; some day this will be the norm. And I would pay through the teeth for it too.dude wanna swap try to watch playoff hockey as an european fan....Me. Work was brutal. Worth it.Me watching the Caps and Canes right now...Luckily I live on the west coast so I get my sleep tooHaha.  Definitely me.  I even talk myself into sleeping for 15mins during intermissions.  Wake up to shake weight infomercial.Imagine living in Europe as a sharks fanEast coast repMy eyes were closing as they scored.That‚Äôs even worse. Sorry budCanadian formula 1 fan checking in... Justice...yup. i'm currently in vancouver but i'm moving back to austria in july. the thing i'm gonna miss most (besides poutine obviously) is being able to watch nhl games during the day.Are there a lot of British people who watch hockey?Yeah I feel your pain. I've just got back from calgary, watching the first round while in Canada was amazing. Doubt I'll get to watch much now I'm back in the UK.Yeah I feel you. German guy really looking forward to the dallas game, really NOT looking forward to it being at 3:30 am.I feel you...I was suffering in the caps vs canes game 7 as a UK residents glad I didn‚Äôt try to watch the Vegas gamesame, watching from germany. got 2h of sleep today.Are you me?Some are on early on Saturdays or Sundays sometimesYeah I feel that too. Enormous Sharks fan since Thornton went there when I was a bit younger, I'm on the east coast. It's brutalMy life right now being stationed in JerseyWent to sleep at the start of the 3rd period because I assumed it was a lock....you know what they say about assumptionsYa when many\* people are still at work :(Zero things like HockeyDyid I dooo thaaattt. I mean, bazingaYou win‚ÄòGot Uni at 9 tomorrow. Game 7 starts at 4.  Okay no Uni tomorrow‚Äô üòÇIt can get bad during playoffs - it's currently 0312 in the morning and I've got the Caps vs Canes game on.At least F1 comes to Canada every year! Granted Canada is huge...I‚Äôm kinda the opposite. I‚Äôm stationed in New Jersey now but moving to Washington State in October. I‚Äôm stoked to watch games and still have time to sleep.There is a fair few of us, it's definitely not the majority.

So worth it though, but the NBC-WA feed didn‚Äôt show a ducking replay of the game winnerYeeLol _burn_Of course, not leaving until OT is decided - even if it kills me.That‚Äôs unfortunateBoom! RoastedGod speed, you animal.It is. I leave in October thoughWell, I can go get some sleep now that I'm 0/8. Fuck, what an anticlimactic ending.     Good fucking game though.Nice, I was there for only 2.5 years with the Marine unit there but it felt like forever.  Couldn‚Äôt have been happier leaving, although I miss the area from time to timeGood luck tomorrow, assuming you work early.Yeah 5 years has been rough
r/nhl, Take note greedy fans who take offerings not meant for them. I've said it before & I'll say it again, I fucking love the inclusiveness of hockey!üòÄüëçüèªüèíThe hockey rink - the only place in the world where banging on glass isn't considered rude! ;-)/r/wholesomegifsWas it so hard to put Marner's name in the title? It's right there on his sweater...Her reaction is so genuine.  That's sweet.Her face when he asks if she wants a selfie... omg, pure joy! That's so great.AwwwwwwwwwwClassy fella. Give him 14 mil. This was lovely Hockey players are the best!!!....NHL player? That‚Äôs Mitchell effing Marner yoAt the end of the day,  this is what its all about. That‚Äôs awesome! You not only made her day, but made a lifetime fan. Love it!Toronto has such great personalities on their teamI fucking love this guy.That's a class act right there good on himHockey is best sportI‚Äôve been this girl before, thanks to Brenden Dillon. You never forget this moment. Ever. It is the most exhilarating rush of emotion to be noticed and appreciated by one of your favorite players. I‚Äôm lucky to have met multiple of my favorite players, and I‚Äôm not sure if they realize how a simple gesture that takes seconds can impact somebodies life so positively.What‚Äôs up with the guy behind her and his aggressive head rubbing?  I mean thanks for not stealing the puck but geez!Man, you just notice how good former London Knights are with fans and in the community. Marner, Horvat, Domi, etc. They churn as many great people as hockey players out of their system.Made her day! I love it.Gotta love Mitchy, always keeping it realThis actually warmed my heart. These things dont hit me hard usually. But the little girls reaction was amazing to me.You want a fan for life?! Because that's how you get a fan for life! Social media managers for the NHL have a lot of wholesome content to work with. Not into hockey, no idea who this guy was until now... but man, what a class act. Always brings a tear to my eye seeing people meet their heroes. Always been a fan of our Canadian neighbors, but I guess I'm also a Maple Leafs fan now![deleted]Post it again, I‚Äôll still upvote it.Anyone crossposted this to r/aww yet?I love how she keeps banging the glass. Memory for a lifetime. Wish we had this in the EIHLCanada I love you Mitch is a beauty üëçüèªüëçüèªLove the maple leafs üëçüèªüëçüèªOh how cute....üòäüòäüòäAnyone see the high five attempt that went denied??Great stuff. I saw Delaursies on Montreal giving a puck before the game in Detroit and the kids love it. This is too cute! hahaha thats friggin awesomeman....that's what hockey is all about. Wish I could make someone that happy.  What a privilege.  Could watch stuff like this all. Fucking. Day.r/upliftingnewsI thought she was gonna cry at a hockey game and she recovered r/hawwkeyThis warms my heart ‚ù§ Marner is a beautyWhen I saw the title I thought this made it to /r/all This makes me so happy, thanks Mitch.Fan for life.  Can't buy stuff like that.  Good on him!AWWWWWWWWWWW AF! This made me tear up. How can you not be romantic about baseball?A Mape fan for life was made that day. Always cool to see. Unless it's the Pens. It‚Äôs the little things like this that keep my faith in humanity going. If she has such a big crush on Mitch Marner, why is she wearing someone else's jersey? Since there is no #9 on this year's roster, I'm guessing it's the jersey of a famous past player. But again if she loves Marner so much, why isn't she wearing a #16?  &#x200B;  Just wondering.Sometimes I wish I was famous so I could do things like this because I don't think enough superstars do outside of sports. Oh Canada. You folks are just so pure. The quick tear wipe then resume slapping the glass gets me. This is awesomeGod dammit this is why I love hockey. I have gone to tons of other sporting events and you hardly ever see anything like this in other sports./r/sportsarefunDid the guy in the second row who grabbed her the puck and rubbed her head also throw Marner "The Shocker?"The best part of this is that it was in another teams building. Awww, so damn cute. :D r/MadeMeSmileYeah, like I said it‚Äôd be exciting to catch the ball. But I‚Äôm not gunna put it in a case on my mantle with a plaque stating ‚Äúfoul ball I caught on May 6th 2014‚Äù that‚Äôs just dumb.  Like homeboy said above, if it was an important ball like a grand slam World Series winner then yeah but other than that, no. Give it to a kid. Great moment for this young fan indeed and something she will always remember but you have to ask yourself, was this a setup by the NHL/ Toronto Maple Leafs to boost their fan base? How exactly did this play so well and think about the footage, where was this done from and by whom?That‚Äôs also something I noticed.  No stray hands even remotely went for the puck.  Normally there‚Äôs a ton of fans trying to snatch the puck.  This was clearly meant for her.Here's the actual pic - https://i.redd.it/2vvj8en7fsg21.jpgIt is so strange when adults try to grab pucks in these situations. It reminds me of baseball games when you see adult men running like idiots to get a foul ball. Let the kids have it, ya dorks. You know it was a group of Canadians surrounding that girl....That‚Äôs her dad This is in canada, every ones nice canadians ..not Americans I'd definitely make the argument that they're the most down to earth athletes we see in sports (US)I've wondered for a while if it's at least in part due to the RELATIVELY low salaries (compared to the other major American professional sports) hockey players get. Keeps most of them at least somewhat down to the earth. Theres only a small number of superstars who go on to make tens of millions, and even that number is staggeringly low compared to the superstars of football, basketball, and baseball.   Couple that with all of the other things that make hockey culture great and you get moments like this. Say it againExcept for PaulStop it! You're hurting their ears!As a Sabres fan, I didn‚Äôt want to bring any undo attention to the player or club...It‚Äôs not a selfie.  The mom has the camera.   It‚Äôs just called a someoneelsie. Came here to say this. Right?!  That joyous hug at the end was so sweet /r/hawwkeyr/aww even.Yep, and send Nylander over to BuffaloLol @ JT[deleted]This game was in Vegas, so there's a decent change they were there together. come on guys....push this to the top.She will next game.Haha.  He went from the Cali bro symbol to shocker real fast.  I think he was tying for the ü§üüèª tbhSomeone else actually caught it because it was tossed bbehind her, and imediately handed it to her. This is hockey. Imagine the chaos in Philly. Poor child would have likely left via stretcher.   /s~~How early?~~That lady to the right tried to reach for it but I think she realized her mistake after the dad handed it to the girlThat is pure joy.Aww, they have the same smile!That is super cute....I still fucking hate the leafs!!At first I thought, I‚Äôve never found a foul ball. Are you gatekeeping my need to cross that off my bucket list?  But then I thought, it‚Äôd be exciting to catch the ball. But wtf am I to do with a baseball I caught at a game? Giving it to a kid would be so much more satisfying and a bigger deal to them. > It reminds me of baseball games when you see adult men running like idiots to get a foul ball.  This might be unpopular, but as someone who is a grown ass man and has never got one, I feel like I would run to get one if I had the chance.  I would then give it to a kid nearby, but I would big time love to snag one of those foul balls one day.   We outgrow some of our dreams, but not all of them ;) They could be there with a child aged 2-5 who may not easily catch it themself, but are old enough to appreciate the memento.  Or they could be jerks.This happened at a game played in Las Vegas.Anyone who lives on the Canadian border can easily attest to how wretched Canadians can be when they come over to do their shopping.  They don't deserve the reputation they've been given, in many cases.I think something that differentiates hockey from other sports is it's like older players are expected to help the next generation. It's not unusual to see coaches or assistants with no kids on a team giving their time.Way to go Pawwl!! I accept your saltiness and approve.  But.  GO LEAFS GO!As a Habs fan I agree with this reasoning She‚Äôs crying üò≠I‚Äôm seeing double! Four Nylanders on Buffalo!Oh hell no. That was borderline nuggy.  Nothing kind about a scalp assault. Hmm that‚Äôs one explanation. Vicious scalp assaults are acceptable by parents. Thats her dadThis is Canada[Giroux makes girls day](https://youtu.be/yldNNCxZWsI) Lol. I was thinking of philly when I saw the guy up top say "this is hockey"I have no idea what you are talking aboutClearly early.Exactly! I got a puck at a minor league hockey game when I was maybe 10 and it meant the world to me. It's since been lost in a game of pond hockey over the years. Unless it's like a ball from the world series or a milestone hit who cares? I think it's still fun if a foul ball comes your way and you catch it, but if there's a kid around give it to them. Seriously?? You're asking what would you do with a baseball you caught? Dang man, must be a casual fan. That would be a huge deal to me since I've also never caught one. And I've been going to games since I was a kid.Or they could want the ball because they've always wanted to catch a foul ball since they were kids themselves? They could have also been trying for years to snag a foul ball, too.  I lucked out with the one I got at a game; it bounced and rolled it's way down to my seat and bumped against my foot. Didn't even have to stand up to get it.Lol I've been going to baseball games for 20 years and never gotten a foul ball/homer.  I've come close a few times.   You can be sure I'm keeping that first one. If I ever get another one I would for sure give it to a kidVegas, canada, what's the difference?Try going to a bar on the Canadian side. Full of 18-20 year old Americans who can't hold their liquor. It isn't uncommon for older players and coaches to offer the rookies a place to live as well as mentoring. Mario Lemieux did it with Crosby when he first joined the Penguins and Patrick Marleau is doing it for one of his teammates on the Leafs.That and how they're brought up thru the system as well. I like to think the salary cap has a lot to do with it too, being how players aren't touted as 200 million dollar contract players at such young ages. Hockey players go thru collegiate hockey and get entry level deals so they stay more level headed. I can't even count the amount of articles i see every year of blackhawk's players visiting hospitals and doing fan signings etc. It's really refreshing compared to other leagues. I agree with you 100%I'm cryingplus 1 foe teaching me how to spell nuggieSeems like an uncle thing to do. Definitely weird if it was a stranger, though. You‚Äôd hope so with that head rub!No, this is Patrick Oh hey Tom, you‚Äôre from Prince George BC? I have a friend Jimmy that lives in the northern Ontario town of Orillia, do you know him?  Edit: happy cake dayHaha good fixVegas has a slightly higher moose populationIt has a lot to do with the culture of hockey. If you‚Äôre a 10-year-old boy on a team and you‚Äôre all about yourself as an individual, your teammates will put you in your place as its a team game. That doesn‚Äôt really happen in other sports.>That and how they're brought up thru the system as well. I like to think the salary cap has a lot to do with it too, being how players aren't touted as 200 million dollar contract players at such young ages.  Yeah I agree, in a weird way it benefits by being the sport athletes will *never* pick for money.  I‚Äôm sure there is outliers, but for the most part, I think every single one of these guys is out there with the same goal they had the first time they put on skates and ate shit, to win the Stanley Cup.  >Hockey players go thru collegiate hockey and get entry level deals so they stay more level headed.  I will say this isn‚Äôt completely true though.  You can be drafted and signed right out of high school or the CHL if you‚Äôre Canadian.  So this is true sometimes but it also isn‚Äôt a given.You're not crying, I'm crying...wait that's backwards..I looked it up, seems it can be nuggy or nuggie. Nuggy seems to also refer to some smoking device lol. Yeah, and mom seems to talk to him / not object to such inappropriate touching. Lmao I was thinking the same thing, idk why would he be sitting behind her? It‚Äôs not like he moved back for the photo, he was already there.Definitely family member, but not dad. I have been to Saskatoon, don't live there but I think I know your friend Jimmy. He's about yay tall, you know the guy with the hair, he plays a little shinny...thinks he is all that but really just a depth guy right?  We're like cousinsI agree 100%Its pregame warmups, those probably aren't their seats.  Ya eh, he‚Äôs a total hoser. Wait you can go down to the glass during pregame warmup? I honestly had no clue but don't say it to him....he has a pool and July and August we hang out at his house. plus his mom is hotHockey‚Äôs the best. Yes, but you shouldn't because it's really annoying to go to your seat and have someone in it when you paid a lot of money to sit on the glass. Happened to me after paying $400 for two tickets and I couldn't do a damn thing because everyone was in their seats so there was literally no where for me to walk. What the H-E-double hockey sticks are ya talkin aboot.  Take off eh, don‚Äôt tell me how to Shovel the snow.  Plus she looks good in my Jersey ehi‚Äôd DEFINITELY be like hey these are my seats and i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd move
r/nhl, The refs sucked last night. Period. Bad calls both ways. As much as I hate one of the bad calls being a game decider against my team, shit happens and this isn‚Äôt the first and won‚Äôt be the last, it‚Äôs over. Eyes forward.As a Sharks fan, NHL Reddit, let it go. We've gotten much worse bad calls/non-calls in the playoffs against us.  Be happy Jumbo got a hat trick and happier he didn't score a fourth. LolAwful officiating both ways in that game. Come on, give it up. They missed a 7 skater Too Many Men call while the Sharks were on the PPer just after to even it up. People make mistakes. Blame the league for not allowing that to be a ‚Äúreviewable‚Äù play.This is beyond dumb. The game officiating was a shit show all around. The Penguins one is more accurate The refs reviewed the Bruins' shot that got swatted at the goal line, with definitive proof it fully crossed the line, then called no goal.Yeah the refs love Marchand and the Bruins. This makes sense...Asking for upvotes is so cheapThis is honestly stupid lol. I admit that the referees fucked up sharks last game with that high stick goal, but weird shit was happening for both sides. Just look at the first period "no goal". It was a shitshow all around. But B's have been getting fucked by bad officiating for some years now. And I am more than sure they will get back on that track after yesterday's fluke game lol. I believe B's were like first or second in the first third of the season in the amount of goals being called no goals after being reviewed (like "50/50 shit, where we call in Toronto" - those mfs don't like B's goals xD)You OBVIOUSLY did not see lsst nite game!!!you act as if you've never had a bad call go your way. Yikes The NHL refs should have to face the media just like NBA refs. These zebras with rashes are getting WORSE. I gotta give my full respect to the linemen tho, those guys take punishment from pucks and punches and are still almost perfect with their offside calls. But he's wearing a B's shirt... Would be more accurate if it was a pens shirtSeriously? Did the ‚Äúno goal‚Äù in the first period not happen?   Wagner‚Äôs goal definitely shouldn‚Äôt have counted, but there were terrible calls going against both teams. Take your loss and move on LOL, what a load of shit.  They send BM to the box every other shift. people keep referencing the missed call in the first. thats fine, the calls even out. But WHAT is the argument for waiting to stop play until  the Sharks are on a 2-0 breakaway??? I'm not that annoyed about the turnout, we still got the point and the bruins aren't in our conference, but c'mon. the refs blew that game for the sharksLmao what As a golden knights fan whose team plays Boston tomorrow, this is disconcerting news.[deleted]this is facts, no matter what team you support, that was one of the worst officiating moments in recent historySharks fan here. If you can overlook all the calls and missed calls, it was still a great game. A playoff atmosphere, a comeback on a penalty shot, a hat trick and overtime!!  One of the best games I‚Äôve been to in a long time. Lets face it folks.  WE live in an era were officiating is terrible in all 4 major sports.  And it doesn't appear to be getting better anytime soon. Stop.Back again, what a joke.Should be a split Jersey. The officiating was horrendous on both teams. Just another salty sharks fan I guessWelp, it‚Äôs seems that fans of the sharks also live in saltwater just like sharks Is that a photo from Game 7 Canucks Bruins?Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Two Thousand and Eleven Accurate hundo p Ah...Vancouver 2011 I see...Bring out the haters but has nobody seen just about every leafs game where they don't get any calls? Last in the league for penalties called. Bring whatever argument you want (ie: they take hardly any penalties so naturally they get less calls for) but just watch the games. The other teams hack, slash, hook, interfere, trip, run leafs players into the boards from behind and the refs put their whistles away. For a top possession team like the leafs, they should get significantly more calls if not at least league average. This has been going on for years. It's a joke. Like I said, bring on the haters.Happy he didn't get a fourth?? That would have been the greatest day in NHL history!Downvoting appropriately because of your final statement about Jumbo.And a blatant missed high stick on Kuraly, a missed slashing call where a Sharks defensemen literally broke his stick across McAvoys chest on a 1on0, a borderline at the very best penalty shot call against Marchand, and oh yea, they missed a fucking goal we scored.  Also don‚Äôt even get me started on that delay of game bench minor.  People acting like the refs gifted the Bruins the game on a silver platter, conveniently forgetting that they yanked it away in the first place.https://imgur.com/a/CioWrkTFor me, tonight, its lightning, but normally I'm with ya.Exactly. This is comical. So if bruins own the refs why was the blatant good goal in 1st period no good? Yea... Maybe some of the high school or the questionable delay of game bench minor that hasn't been called in 20 years...Learn to take a jokeAnd I think technically against Reddit ToS but I just came here for the ‚Äúrefs sucked for [insert team]‚Äù circlejerk. Was not disappointed.Theres litterally no accountability that we can see publicly and its a fuckin joke. I think everyone would be happier if the NHL came out and apologized for that game on both sides, some of the things they just let go just shouldnt fly as proffesionals.> WHAT is the argument for waiting to stop play until the Sharks are on a 2-0 breakaway  That's not *exactly* what happened. They waited for the Bruins to lose possession... and then seemingly forgot for a few seconds. The question is why they didn't fix it immediately once play left the zone.This is the bigger issue to me. It's such an obvious issue to rectify during the game, and why on earth wasn't it attended to?It was Kane that knocked the net off. So the play isn't blown dead until the Sharks have possession.  &#x200B;  The ref can (and frequent will) fix the net after play goes the other way, but chose not to.Why would they upvote this if they're whining?It was a very entertaining game, which to me makes the terrible reffing even worse.The officiating is always horrendous.  It is a feature not a bug.  Because the NHL is after the casual fan as if there is a such thing as a casual hockey fan...  They have turned the NHL into the NBA, and games are 50% special teams... and that is awful hockey to watch. LOL, unfortunately that team was filled with cowards and when they finally faced a team willing to push back they showed as much every chance they could.  Thank god they didn't win, because that group of pansies would have tarnished every name on the cup. Lol. It's a little tongue in cheek for the uninitiated, I obviously would've been thrilled if he got a 4 goal game with a OT gwg.That's fair. LolBruins (and Sharks) fan here. Refs also missed a lot of calls on the Bruins, too. You're not wrong about the refs handing the game to the Bruins, but don't pretend like the Bruins didn't benefit a great deal amount from the refs either.^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)  **https://i.imgur.com/7yLv7KH.jpg**  ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20eguihfm) Learn to take a lossüêîüêîüêîüêî5 goals is pretty special though.

r/nhl, Being a fan of this team is not good for my health.Question: Why are they called the Toronto Maple Leafs and not the Toronto Maple Leaves?Still a good team. They made it to a game 7, more than I can say about the team I usually cheer for. Next year boys....26 years and counting since any Canadian Team won the Stanley Cup now.

That city deserves sooooo much better!I understand why people hate the Leafs   But really, fuck Boston tooI think we can all agree that the Leafs have to be one of the most losing teams in sports history.. they haven‚Äôt won the Stanley cup since 1967. They haven‚Äôt even won a playoff series since 2004...  there has to be a curse or somethingThis is why, should they ever win again, Leaf fans have an obligation to be as obnoxious as humanly possible.To think, two of my teams had the longest droughts in their sports' histories, ended them within six years of each other, and now I get to revel in the misery of others.Canada: Cup Free Since '93How do you know it‚Äôs spring time?

Obligatory clarification: I‚Äôm neither a Bruins or Leafs fan.   There was a play where the puck was called onside by the ref. Close call, very well may have been offside or could‚Äôve been onside. No replay, just a plain ref judgment call.  On tv you could clearly see a Boston fan stand up and actively, repeatedly flip off the ref. In a sense I get it when fans get pissed off on important stuff and meaningful moments, but that just seemed unnecessary, especially up two goals.   Is that just a hockey fan being a hockey fan or is that your stereotypical Bostonian behavior on display?St._Louis_Blues.jpg  (please disregard if they actually win the cup this year)I always think it's bad being teased as a wild card contender (Flyers), but after watching your series, I'm happy just not evening getting a birth.Try being an Oiler fan. One of the best on the planet and we still look forward to draft lotteries on a yearly basis.*cries in Canuck*It‚Äôs so mentally exhausting to be passionate about something that gives you nothing in returnYou should try being a Canucks fan,   oh how great it isThey are a singular Leaf, and a proper noun.There are many reasons cited as to why they were named that, but I do believe the main reason for it was they named themselves after the Maple Leaf Regiment from WWIBecause they leave in a first round exit.Can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a clever pun or a legit questionBecause they aren't actual leaves.  More technically, the term "Maple Leaf" is a single 'word', rather than the transparent compound "maple leaf."  In a transparent compound of two parts, one part is the head, and the other the modifier. In "maple leaf", *maple* modifies *leaf,* as in "the leaf of the maple tree."  A transparent compound acquires the grammatical features of its head. So, since *leaf* is a noun and *leaf* is the head of *maple leaf, maple leaf* is also a noun.  Also, since the head has the irregular plural *leaves*, so does the compound: *Maple leaves lay strewn about my lawn.*  The team name "Maple Leaf" is taken as a single item, not a transparent compound.  As a 'new word', it has no irregularities in its use.  Since it isn't strictly a compound, it has no head.  Therefore, when we pluralize it, we run it through the regular grammar, and the plural form that goes with words ending in -/f/ is -/s/.  Hence, *Maple Leafs lay crestfallen after yet another first-round elimination.*     We do this with other names, too.  The Leaf family, for instance, would be the *Leafs*, not the Leaves.Or the Toronto Maple laughsWhen they were created their was another team known as the Leaves and that would've created copyright issues, it's something like that I can't remember it exactlyCopyright. Back in their inception, there was already a collegiate team called the Maple Leaves. They chose the grammatically incorrect ‚ÄúLeafs‚ÄùI was actually just thinking about thatCuz they are retardsCries in Canuck.. tho many of us didn't expect them to make it this yearThe elephant that I will never see a Canadian team lift the cup again in my lifetime, and that the Canucks were our last best hope?Yeah but I don‚Äôt want Toronto to be the team that brings it back. Fuck the leafsThere is no elephant. All nhl teams are made up of Canadian players. Damn near every team has a superstar Canadian player on their roster. Canada is represented any time the cup in raised since the beginning of time. Playing on a Canadian team comes with more pressure and higher expectations. A lot of players would rather avoid that and just play hockey without the circus.Calgary has a future in this leaguePlenty of Canadians have won the Stanley Cup on American teams thoughHow does that even matter when most of the players on the American teams are from different countries anyway? >_>If you lived here you would understand the madness. There like the kid that you always beat in a video game but the one time they beat you theyll never let you hear the end of it.The leafs are the only North American sports franchise to have an entire channel that only shows content of the team.  I can imagine that attention like that becomes infuriating  ‚Äî a leafs fanExcept if you‚Äôre French Canadian, media is just shoving the Leafs down everyone‚Äôs throats when there are six other teams in the country. It‚Äôs insufferable.We gave up on the leafs long ago.The same reason any sports fan doesn‚Äôt like any other rival team and its fan base.He's not coming back next year due to his contract and our potential cap issues so we won't need to worry about that, hopefully he goes to the Bs and we can ride the expressway next seasonLeafs fan, fully 100% agreeConsecutive playoff appearances what team do you cheer for buddyGive me Lindstrom in his prime , add the supporting cast he had in Detroit,  and I‚Äôll probably have a good coaching record as well.  I‚Äôd do it for less then 5M too.Big yikes. Also, our stars' contracts are so inflated it sickens me.I'm a hockey fan in general. Sure some fans are insufferable but all fan bases have those individuals. As previous people have stated the media is what I think causes alot of resentment towards the leafs from other canadian fans. Listen  to any hockey coverage it's always about the leafs if you didn't know better you would think they were the only team in this country at times. No matter if the team is good or bad all you hear about is the leafs it's almost sickening.I come in peace when I say this, just want to float my own two cents to you. My personal issue with a lot of leaf fans is the self righteousness. I hear a lot of leafs fans talk about how they‚Äôre the best fan base and the most supportive of their team, like how Tavares got cheered to oblivion in his first game back after isles fans went apeshit on him, but the same fans who were on their high horse for that seem to be the same ones who were giving Jake Gardiner death threats last year. And of course the fact that these fans act like they‚Äôre the best when they haven‚Äôt won a cup with more than six teams in the league. Again, I‚Äôm not trying to put you down, I‚Äôm just venturing what I myself have seen.We're fun to laugh at, we just keep on losing and losing, it's life, we're still here for some reason tho so I guess we can't really complainat this point we are just fun to laugh at. Hurts being kicked again adn again while you are down.lol try being an Islander fan when Tavares left. You guys were complete douchesI'll get downvoted for this, but I'm a Canadian and can confirm the Leaf fan base is the worst in any sport. Self righteousness for one, and how they're over the top in assumption.  They win 3 straight in the first week of regular season, and there are plans for a cup parade route downtown.  Not to mention, alot of the sports media in Canada is based in Toronto. They will tell you what color Auston Matthew's shit was on any day of the week, or what Mitch Marner's aunt baked him for his 9th birthday.   I watched a game between the Leafs  and Canadiens, and when Montreal scored, there LEGIT wasn't even a replay of the goal. Only a shot of the disappointed Leafs bench and went to TV timeout. When Toronto scored, they showed every possible angle of the goal, explained how much the players meant to the team, how much their contract was worth, and even at intermission, went back to the Toronto replays and ran them again.  The Toronto sports media is outrageously biased and floods all Canadian press, radio and TV with their drama.  Sorry folks, but dont pick up Jake Muzzin and explain that he solidifies your run for the Cup.  Original Six fan bases are by far the most passionate but all are storied franchises that have phenomenal success in the past. Toronto doesn't come close to any of the other 5 teams but yet, gets the most media coverage which in turn makes them even more of a laughing stock and endless fun to make fun of.   The media ruins Toronto Maple Leafs, and the fans definitely dont help.Bc we have so many fans so the toxicity of the normies is increased more than any other fanbase but not all leafs fans ae like thisThey hate us cuz they anus ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBecause you are.

You guys just didn‚Äôt crap out as bad as you needed to to get another star with McDavidYeah, it's like a toxic relationship.Thank God the regiment had better success.IIRC, the Blackhawks were also named after a regiment from WWI, but on the American side.damn u savageCasual hockey fan here. Legit question. I wish I was that clever hahaThis guy grammars!Yeah it was the Nantucket Eatshootsandleaves  Their mascot was an ice pandaThe Maple Leafs say that the name was chosen in honour of the Maple Leaf Regiment from World War I.*The Maple Leaf Forever*Thank you!Well no that‚Äôs not true. The Maple Leafs say that the name was chosen in honour of the Maple Leaf Regiment from World War I.The elephant that for some reason/'s, Canadian teams are seemingly incapable of winning the Stanley Cup and what's the fix or is there even one?The leafs will win a cup, they just aren't there yet..As an average team, per usual.  Edit: Calgary has 0 Stanley cup championship potential.> ... are from Canada  ftfyCouldn't have said it better myself.True but we French Canadians despise the Leafs just as much as the rest of Canada because of their insufferable fans.[deleted]Thank you for your honesty. ;-)   I've lived in Toronto for about 30 years, and I'm almost 51. They last won the cup the year before I was born. For a while now I've been wanting to place a bet that they won't win before I start collecting Canada Pension at 65.Making the playoffs two years in a row is a pretty fucking low bar to set.I‚Äôm a leaf fan...What do you mean when you say we think we are the best? In my experience, fellow Leafs fans are more pessimistic and marinated in the constant disappointment of failure than any fanbase on earth. I never understand this cockiness accusation. Leafs fans are miles from cocky. We are traumatised.They also look down on other team and act like they know the game better then anyone else. . As a Habs fan i have seen them acting so superior in ever game thread when we played them. They are often condescending and thick their line up is soooooo great and superior. The Habs finished THREE points behind Toronto so yes the Leafs had a better season but barely. Yet they think they are a cup contender and la cr√®me de la cr√®me.I agree with a lot of your points. However, The TML is a money maker. Without them the media and NHL would be missing out on a fair chunk of money.  That no replay of mtl goal but replay of leaf goals is total bullshit.   Toronto doesn‚Äôt come close to the other original 6 franchises? That‚Äôs just a stupid statement. They have second all time amount of cups. It‚Äôs the hockey Mecca of the world.   Hate em all you want.[deleted][deleted]Lol at least we didnt sink all our money into one shitty team and lose first round as usual. Your GM did it to you. Go find a few defensemen, a coach with recent success. This year was your best chance and you played Gardiner...Like does it matter? The Leafs have the second largest amount of Stanley Cups.Oh no...Tell me more about this ‚Äúfucking game‚Äù üòèBad formü§£ü§£ü§£ Good bot.

Pretend you were clever.The ice panda sounds Snizzy, not gonna lieThat person is incorrect. The Maple Leafs say that the name was chosen in honour of the Maple Leaf Regiment from World War I.Maybe. I read that in a hockey history book when I was a child so it may or may not be trueWhy fix it? What do you even do for that? They arent given any handicap. They have to follow the same rules as the American teams.\*blames Gary\*I think that reason might be the almighty (US) dollar.Rebuild!Exactly my thoughts.   &#x200B;  Canadian teams don't win because we don't have our best Canadian players on the teams; if we did America would be cryingI didn't say we despised them any less haha. I was strictly talking about media coverage and ours doesn't care about the Leafs reallyBecause of two reasons. There fans are insufferable, they thought Matthews was better than McDavid strictly because he was a leaf. Then even worse the media shoves them down the throat of every Canadian because of there blatant bias towards the leafs. Then to loop the fans back in they say the coverage should be to them because there the best team in the league and should get the coverage. It‚Äôs just absolutely awful.Might be dead to be honest, I'm 17 and started watching at about 9, I think I'll be dead before a cup comesFor most teams, yes If you look at the Leafs record in the past decades that‚Äôs actually quite an accomplishment. This is a good as the Leafs get.Ahh then i understand that that comes from pain not hateI said think they have the best fan base.First paragraph brother. 2 reasons. Self righteousness  and over assumptions. I focused on media because it makes the fans worse because of the coverage all season. This inflates the heads of Leafs fans into confusion and the assumption that they'll have a chance.Local media? It‚Äôs Sportsnet and TSN, not local media.As a Leafs fan, Do you understand how to put sentences together? Please do everyone a favor and edit. Smh. Just go to bed. I know you're upset.You shit talk our GM, whilst your team made the worst trade in hockey historyReally. You think winning amongst six teams of frenchies is comparatively winning today.It's where the leafs bend over and get fucked.Are your feelings hurt?Birds are nice hahaActually little known fact, and quite the coincidence, but Snizzy was their ice panda mascot's name!One of their (leafs) ECHL affiliates are the Solar Bears. It's based in Orlando.According to their Wikipedia page that is where the name came from. They do mention that Conn Smythe did used to scout a team called ‚Äúeast Toronto maple leafs‚Äù which may have informed the decision. It doesn‚Äôt mention though a team with the name ‚Äúleaves‚Äù.Actually not true, Canadian income tax is much higher.... And I'm a wings fan.Canadian team salaries are paid in American dollars. Part of why the teams profit share.I've noticed this undercurrent of Canada hate ever since coming here tonight for the lol Toronto memes. It's sooo weird.That's the Olympics, right?  But this is the NHLI know I just wanted to point out how very Canadian we are when it comes to hating the Leafs.  https://streamable.com/se6fx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_appNothing you said is even remotely true.The cubs had to wait 108 years, so anything is possible lolSure, but that was pretty clearly not this guy's point.It comes from living in reality. 0-1% chance the Leafs win a cup in the next decade. Best team we‚Äôve fielded in years and we can‚Äôt get past the first round.You are a fuckin pervert. You creepy fuck. Quit pm‚Äông me dick picks. Wow.Yes and it‚Äôs the same exact thing but with some random expansion team coming in.Not anymore thanks for asking.Are you fucking serious? That's just my common word manConn Smythe was actually part of the Maple Leaf regiment I believe. He named the Leafs after it.   His grandson wrote a book and talks a bit about Conn‚Äôs experience in WWI and then goes on to explain that Conn named the team after the regiment he served in.Didn't hurt Toronto's signings last summer.   You could say Stamkos stayed in Florida for the taxes, or that he got to stay on a pretty deep squad with the best chance to make the cup, and blew it... So there was no reason to have to Abaddon the only fanbase he's played for and go to Toronto for the same.Are you suggesting that is the actual reason for Canadian Clubs‚Äô drought?  NHL teams, not the Whiskey.Honestly I bet if we held a referendum to exempt NHL players from taxes people would go for it ehGolden.I lived in Edmonton and Halifax most of my life and pretty much everything he said is true. Most Canadian fans can‚Äôt stand leafs fans. Not even the franchise itself but their fans. They aren‚Äôt all bad but there are so many that just blindly cheer for them and cannot admit any fault in the team despite continually losing for 52 years. Most of the Canadian sports channels show 30 minutes of leafs coverage and maybe 3-4 minutes of other Canadian teams so not only do we watch them lose year after year, we have to listen to them talk about for days on end afterwards.Maybe not in your case, but ya that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to live outside of Toronto and not be a leaf fan. And yes the pet about McDavid is 100% true. Look up countless stupid articles of Toronto writers saying it‚Äôs true.  Look at your fan base, McDavid says he‚Äôs frustrated and all of a sudden he‚Äôs going to be a leaf because that‚Äôs obviously what he wants. Yet Matthews has a riff with the leafs every year, and signed only up to his free agency but never a conversation about him wanting out. The delusion of leaf fans is nauseating.Today‚Äôs news of debrusk brought me back here again to remind you why your the worst in the league. But hey atleast it wasn‚Äôt your own goalie this time. You‚Äôve directing death threats outside your city nowBy 108 years we might win one playoff series lol0-1% in. Decade is not a realistic figure you're bitterLol go ahead and prove it. Just go make up shit stories like the Toronto media does.  This, my fellow reddit friends, is a TRUE Leafs fan.   Why would you come to a post that is mocking your team that you evidently still have fresh wounds from. And then when you lose an argument, you just give up and claim I'm sending dick pics lmao. You really give your Toronto Maple Leafs a good name. Just go to bed fella.Wow.So statistically speaking you think it's just as impressive to win a cup in a 6-team league as it is in a 31-team league?It might not have hurt Toronto's signings last summer, but it will hurt the signings to come. Marner needs to get paid and they still need to fix their defense.  Look at the Sparks contract to get a sense of what kind of signings will be made in the next couple years. They can't afford to commit more money to a backup goalie if they hope to sign Marner this summer.It is a contributing factor, not the sole reason...I would say Canadian Whiskey is a contributing factor, but i think all/most NHL players indulge in quite a ridiculous amount of heavy drinking.They would. I‚Äôd vote for a politician that could promise a Stanley Cup for Montreal.Well from 1966/67 until 2018/19 we‚Äôve won the cup at a rate of 1.9%. So my forecast is not unrealistic.Honestly, bigstudley is the believable one here.Yes and it‚Äôs the same thing all over again. Get a slightly large amount of wins to get to the playoffs, and once you beat all the rounds, you get the Stanley Cup.Not at all my point. Cap issues are a different conversation.Can‚Äôt tell if I was unclear or if this is a joke.  ...take the upvote anyway!Haha, me too (for my sports teams). I think this may be the problem with politics today. Oh well!Only one way to find out, right? Get him to prove itHow so? When the league was six teams, four would advance to the playoffs....thats a 66% chance of reaching the playoffs, assuming everything else is equal. Those odds are 16/31 today, just over 50%. Back then, you would need to win two series to win the cup, so each of the 4 eligible teams had a 25% chance of winning the cup, again assuming all else is equal. Today with 16 teams competing, those odds drop to 6%. This is the main reason that dynasties are so much more rare now, and so much more impressive when they do happen.Besides, you've shown zero sportsmanship towards this lad here; even I'd admit the leafs were whooping the Bruins for a time.If you're so full of contemplation, why dont you just get the facts and stop turning your own post into shit?  The guy is butt hurt from his team losing, he then comes into a post that was mocking his team, he gets ripped on, then claims I'm sending him dick pics and then we dont hear from him again, yet I'm still here.  This whole 'back and forth' is a PRIME example of what's wrong with Leafs fans. Albeit, what you were primarily after. Does this finally answer your question? Just end it and get the mods involved if you'd like ü§£
r/nhl, "And now on to hockey where.. BREAKING NEWS LEBRON JAMES CHANGES HIS BREAKFAST ROUTINE"[deleted]I miss TSN but it's this attitude that has made me stop watching ESPN almost entirely.  Thank you NHL Network.  Not quite as good as TSN but a million times better than ESPN.I completely agree. But what irritates me the most, is how they schedule a game to be played on the NHL Network but they don't actually play the game. It's all NHL on the Fly about Playoff games coming up in the next couple days, EVEN THOUGH THE AVS GAME WAS CURRENTLY ON.  I hate living in a different state than my sports teams.I'd just like to say that the Stars have had a couple good burns:  https://twitter.com/DallasStars/status/459162152817790977  https://twitter.com/DallasStars/status/288666995044519937ESPN heavily covers sports it has the rights to air and it loves to pump as many commercial breaks as physically possible into a game.   So if ESPN were to cover hockey we would probably get 2 to 3 more commercial breaks a period and seriously ruin the enjoyment of watching a game. NBC is bad enough with the 3 commercial breaks between the top of the hour and the puck drop.espn has become the TLC of sports.What a useless tweet by ESPN. Why not tweet an interesting fact about the sharks instead What kind of a fucking tweet is that by ESPN...It's funny because it's trueBRAVO!God, this makes me happy. But seriously, the highlights are 20 seconds a piece, what the hell ESPN?shots fired. love it 3 playoff games last night.  Not one story about any of them on the front page of ESPN.That's just a back. Where's the forth?Shots fired.The best NHL related account has to be the Kings. No idea who they hired to run it, but bravo. They have actually been showing hockey highlights. that is good but the kings twitter gets the crown for best nhl team account. Ehh, what do you expect from company owned by Disney.The ringtone on my phone is actually the ESPN National Hockey Night theme. I wish NHL Network would steal Gary Thorn. His voice belongs in hockey, not doing Orioles baseball. Im liking these Sharknados already.Rekt ESPN is the TMZ of sports.I hate ESPN and most of the idiots on the show. They know nothing about sports.Damn straight SJ! Screw the NBA!This was so long ago"Now in the world of hockey...LeBron James scored a career high of 100 points....shit...uhh...yeah, we got nothin."You spelled favorite* wrong...Only thing San Jose has ever done worth seeing.No cause hockey sucks lolHey hockey, thoughts on producing highlights people care to watch? And now to our ONE AND ONLY Hockey guy, that dude with gray slicked-back hair and Canadian accent! Hashtag cool!And in other news, the Stanley Cup final today was one of the best we have ever.... THIS JUST IN, COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYER BREAKING UP WITH INTERNET GIRLFRIEND.  THE SIDE BAR HERE HAS HIGHLIGHTS COMING UP NEXT BUT THATS BULLSHIT CUZ WE ARE ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT SOME COLLEGE ROMANCE FOR THE NEXT 2 HOURS   This is why i stopped watching FacebookTV, i mean ESPNSharks should announce they've signed Lebron James.Your username. I like it.I'm lucky, I just watch TSN. Oh and Sportsnet.[deleted]I don't get why nhlnet doesn't play sportscentre or any sportsnet/CBC hockey programs. one of my favorite things about the old fox soccer was sky sports news. Its nice to have the insight from a place where the sport matters and is not intentionally ignored. Though sky sports never really covered NFL...I have to purchase the Center Ice package as a New Yorker whose team is in Detroit.  On the upside, I get to see a lot of commercials I never would have seen.  I can also recommend a great tire shop if you need one.I'm right there with you buddy. I don't know if you pay more to have NHLN or not, but if you do you should consider reallocating that money and getting Gamecenter.I'm outside of COL as well. If it's not on the NHL network it's either on CNBC or NBCSN. Tonight, the game is on CNBC for me.As far as playoffs are concerned, I feel your pain.Vipbox.net Live streaming all games. Have to play around with links but free .Personally, I get sick of all the eastern conference circle jerk that happens on the NHLN. "similarly in the category of nobody-cares... The NHL is back!"   Wow , the Cowboys official account tweeted that? That's some pretty unprofessional bullshit... The Dallas account is really good. I even liked [this one](https://twitter.com/DallasStars/statuses/426539803908521984)I was a huge fan of [this one.](http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/1/24/5342394/dallas-stars-justin-bieber-picture-twitter)rektI definitely don't want games on ESPN. I just want hockey news.Something worth noting is that the commercial break frequency in-game isn't regulated by network. There's a break at the first stoppage past 6:00, 10:00, and 14:00, no matter where you watch. No commercials in playoff OT games.  ESPN might try to renegotiate the amount of/length of commercial time if they reacquired any rights, though. I'm pretty sure the NHL has a formula for commercial breaks it has worked out with the networks.  Not that this stops a network from just going to a commercial regardless of what is happening on the ice.ESPN would probably have better commentary than NBC, or at least more entertaining. Neither of them are assertions of fact so how can they be true?You spelt "asshole" wrong...You mad bro Butthurt LA fan, priceless!You came to a hockey subreddit... and insulted hockey? What were you hoping would happen there?Barry Melrose is a horse god amongst steeds. #coolistheruleAm I the only one here old enough to remember the commercial when Melrose was still coach of the Kings, wherein he's shown talking to his team and warning them about the Anaheim Mighty Pelicans?His name is Barry Melrose and he is a legend.I love TSN but can't stand Sportsnet. Not looking forward to the next 12 years.Thanks for the advice. I can't wait to try this site out. Does Gamecenter do any playoff games? At least in Canada they all seem to be nationally televised.Yeah the guy who did it got fired and they almost immediately apologized. But yeah the asshole accidentally left the cowboys official open instead of his personal account. "Oh go suck a dick, CMcG14." - @dallascowboys[deleted]Wait, ESPN has news?Understood. I bet that espn brass would be lobbying for more and longer breaks. In theory couldn't a network just go to a commercial whenever they felt like it if there weren't enough breaks for them, or are they contractually barred from doing that?ESPN has Chris Berman. Therefore, their commentary is shit regardless of who is commentating. He ruins it for everybody. I hate Chris Berman.Doc is better than anyone ESPN can offer.At least we could stop getting the obvious Chicago homer squad on *every* Chicago AND Detroit game....It's all the Kraft DinnerI actually can't stand Melrose.  Not sure if its him, or if its the producers insisting on treating hockey like some circus act that the other anchors seem to report on/comment on sarcastically.  I know in the US you have to use the NBCSN app instead for playoffs, dunno about elsewhere[deleted]No, Gamecenter only hosts games that you don't get in your area and playoff games are hosted nationally as well in the US.  I was suggesting it to /u/PortableJoyStick because it is what we use in my household. I am a Caps fan and my SO is a Wings fan but we live in Colorado so we, obviously, don't get those games (unless it's the Wednesday night rivalry game on NBCSN). So we use Gamecenter a lot!   Edit: I may have misinterpreted the original comment, I'm not sure if /u/PortableJoyStick was discussing the current playoffs, but this was a suggestion for out-of-state fans during regular season!  He may have claimed it, but I don't buy it. That is the oldest excuse for inappropriate business tweets there is.Wow. I had completely forgot about those days.  Or when I used to miss a game when I was in middle school and would have to go read the scores in the newspaper the next day...  I couldn't read enough about those 96 Penguins I was sure they were going to win it that year.True, it would just be cool to get it on TV.It's an NHL-regulated element - they decided this in advance. Unlike orange-armed-man in the NFL signaling stoppages from above or innings providing natural breaks in baseball, the refs already know when the commercials will be. It's a system - go to commercial at (this time) unless it's an icing or during a power play. The network cannot control when its commercials will be. fuck you chris berman is a god damn legend. can confirm. KD is the oil that makes Canada run.I never thought of that. I used to subscribe to unbolck-us for Netflix.  I noticed Gamecenter is at bargain prices right now. Might have to think about doing that.  Although I assume they put more effort into shutting down spoofers than Netflix.I mean its definitely a job loss scenario. That's the only reason I think it would have an validity. But yeah fuck that guy either way   Edit: accidentally typed gay instead of guy. woops Fuck *you* buddy, Chris Berman repeats the same 6-7 goddamn phrases of his that were old 20 years ago. He'd fit a "back back back back" comment into an interview about how he got to be such a disgusting egotistical jackass.I thought that was syrup?[deleted]> But yeah fuck that gay either way   Hey, what did the gays do? ;-)COME ON MAN!... Actually I think that's a completely different channel.That's your own (shitty) opinion , to each their ownWell, I know what I'm doing next year.guy* oopsHaha no you're right but that's not exclusively his phrase. It's all those guys including our lord and savior Ditka, praise be his nameDitka.
r/nhl, Washington capitals were like this for yearsDon't listen to the haters, this gave me a good chuckle.Get the f**king brooms out tonight. Columbus has been looking like a juggernautI made multiple brackets, a few using the best analysis I could do using stats, regular season matchups, record for each team‚Äôs last 10 games, performance post-trade deadline and then one last bracket I made for fun going with my best guesses/wishful thinking with CBJ winning the Stanley cup.   So far that last bracket is my only fairly accurate one.The president trophy is very much awarded to the best team in the worst division every year. Tampa had no competition in their division save for Boston and Toronto. It did nothing but inflate their win totals. The metro is and has been the best division for the past 4 seasons and it's the reason why this "upset" occurred. You have WSH. PIT, CBJ, CAR, and NYI all very much cup contenders (not to mention the past three cups have been won in this division) that is five contending teams which does not leave much spread in the standings as what we saw in the Atlantic. It is the same reason why the winner of the Presidents trophy RARELY wins the cup. Simply put of you put a great team together and force them to play poor competition all season you get the 2018-19 Tampa Bay Lightning.HAHAHAHA AWW MAN THIS IS THE BESTNeed to get rid of cooper as soon as this game is over withThe curse is worseDamn this meme got real üòÇüòÇWe have a Cup thoughOh, That's a good one!!Congratulations to the guy who made the "fuck it" bracket.Fuck thisMediocre meme. They've won the cup. Should be the Sharks.We don't talk about the dark times.You' re right, but sometimes it is funI'm glad you see it. Tampa hasn't been playing bad. Most people just stop and assume Tampa is choking, but if you watch how many Jackets are busting their asses out there contributing, and then add Bobrovsky filling in any of the gaps, you'll see the Jackets are just playing crazy good hockey.Yep, that's true, but i hope Tampa lose, cause than i can roast my friend in schoolGood job mate, i have done like five brackets, but ONLY in my dream one Will leafs be in conference final with islanders. IT won't happen maybe but i hope soI said this before the match ups were set. CBJ has been on the brink of being a true cup contender the past few seasons, they have been buried behind PIT and WSH for a while now, and as a result have been largely overlooked. I said if CBJ wins a series they will be the team to win the East. This team feels much like the 2017 Predators. The talent was there just needed all lit together and with the first series win ever in CBJ that fan base is about to explode.Okay, So i forget to write here Tampa bay 2019, but still, Tampa is now the best meme thing, until Maple leafs got eliminated by Boston.Triggered a wee bit there bud? LmaoIt‚Äôs calm-down timeYes. Definitely the Sharks. No other team hasn't won a cup has ever won that accursed thing and gotten blown out of the first round. EVER. It should definitely be the Sharks.mEdiOcRe mEmEDoesn't matter got a cupA sweep is a sweep, though.They forecheck like their lives depend on it.   Congrats CBJ!Nah the lightning aren‚Äôt playing good at all, the jackets are just taking advantage of a paranoid teamHave mercy we are on suicide watch. He may need a shoulder to cry onRoast awayLeafs got this, bud. You just got to believe.When CBJ made those big trades at the deadline they were for sure banking their future on this post season and for a second they almost didn‚Äôt make it to the playoffs. Glad they did and now everyone is firing on all cylinders and really playing like a team even more than they did all season.> until Maple leafs got eliminated by Boston.  *Begins laughing nervously* That's absurd... that could never happen... right?Don‚Äôt engage this goof, his downvotes speak volumesYou know, this is to situation what is happening Now, if any any other team would win pressidents trophy, and than will be losing 3:0 in the series i Will make joke of it, thats jokes. And i can say it clearly that if leafs (my favorite team) would be winning over Boston 3:1 and, than lose 3:4, i would make joke of it, it is SimpleAnd we‚Äôre still alive!All that matters.He give when the series where 2:0, And He Said that He Is Now fan of Minnesota. I don't know if this is step  backwards o≈ô upwardsYa'll are sensitive. 92 downvotes are all Sharks fans?I was making a joke about my Blues (see 2000 playoffs)considering MN is known for being the international poster child for finishing in second place  &#x200B;  At least Tampa has a Stanley Cup, and a Lombardi ... with only the Twins of 87 and 91, MN is simply the greatest to come in 2nd placeYa‚Äôll make dumb comments, sucks to suckOoops, sorry i don't get it. My bad, i was still in mood when some Tampa fan crtitises my meme, And i need to answer him calmly, And normallyEven the North Stars finished 2nd...twice xDoof, NS still break my ever loving northern MN native heart
r/nhl, Good thing they had a ref there to call it a goal.Did he win a car?I was at a game against the Red Wings (Boo!) and he got a goal with a shot somewhat similar to this. Empty net and everything haha it was great.      [Found the clip!](https://youtu.be/YB6TEDp94-k)Hextall would approve.he hocked that puck right down the fuckin goober hole! Bubbles?Dude has a gnarly neckbeard.damn nice shot!I once won a raffle at a local WSHL game and got to go attempt this shot during intermission. They had the same wall up covering the net with a tiny hole in it. I was at the game with a couple of friends for a night of drinking and I was at the point where my vision was just starting to get a little fuzzy. I only had to shoot from center ice but even then I couldn't even see the hole I was supposed to be aiming for. I missed the entire net.Ron Hextall is smiling right now.i read itas "200th"   hah! time for bedIf he could make a save from that distance I would be more impressed. This was great, I turned on the TV and this happened.You know the Red Wings are on the decline when you get swept by the coyotes in the regular season That is stupidLOVED IT!!![deleted]"Let's go to Toronto and check for goalie interference"The refs reaction was hilarious when he saw it go inHe should work for La LigaNeed 2 in a row for the car With 0.1 left on the clock to boot... Savage! Up voting the "boo"That's what I thought, and it made sense because Canada. M'goalieIt evolved out of [benefit games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game#Benefit_games) for injured former NHL players.  I dunno, I enjoy watching all of our stars have fun, and play strange competitions on the ice (fastest skater was cool to watch).  It's not really a big deal, or competitive, just something to enjoy.  I get to watch everyone else's big players in a venue that's not "against my team," so that's refreshing.Kids love crap like this, plus seeing g all the stars at one game, so that's the reason I think they should never get ride of it.  The NHL also uses it to get all their sponsors in one place and show them a good time, and have the reps meet with the players, and to get potential sponsors to meet stars etc... I think its fun. The access to the players is maybe only paralleled to MLB and they are having so much fun.  Watching Ryker school a shootout goal on Carey Price will be a memory in my mind about why I love hockey so much.I didn't down vote you because that's a legitimate question.  It's an exhibition. It has no real purpose other than players to pat themselves on the back and for the fans to watch. I don't personally watch it or care for it. If they gave it a real purpose I'd care more.  Maybe in the future they'll figure out how to incorporate it into the Stanley Cup Finals. Like, starting or ending home ice, I don't know... considering how much money they put up for it, they should give it a real purpose.Seemed like it was straight from a hockey video game.There's this arcade place called "Smaaash" that just opened at the Mall of America, and they have a hockey game where you have to score five times to win a new Harley motorcycle.  Thing is, they're based out of India and had NO idea how popular hockey is in Minnesota. Two or three bikes were won in the first couple of hours lol. They changed the prize to a gift card or something.Go Wild!!! I'm just stuck in Az with the Coyotes. And another for old times sake.I have some news for you about the Stanley Cup. There's no real purpose to it either except as entertainment people watch.[Link] (http://m.startribune.com/smaaash-arcade-at-mall-of-america-quickly-learns-why-this-is-the-state-of-hockey/408108116/) Up voting the Go Wild!

As someone who has been to two PWG matches, I am ashamed. Fun fact: Kevin named his son Owen in memory of Owen Hart.No reviews?  I'll look elsewhere.The Bruins fans absolutely did not invent this joke. That's cute though. It's been around a really long time.thanks buddy![Ask and ye shall receive](http://i.imgur.com/z0ofk8I.png)He was NEVER best friends with Chris Jericho! ...how could you possibly be in the loop enough to know who Kevin Steen is, but not in the loop enough to know his WWE name is Kevin Owens.  Like actually how?YES. Same wrestler.Nice! That is a fun fact.Did you know bruins fans also invented the wheel?Awesome, thanks!My roommate dragged me to the PWG shows and I enjoyed them a lot- enough to have a passive interest when he watches RAW and the major matches. That makes sense I guess.  Indy wrestling is usually so far down the rabbit hole that even people like me who watch zero WWE content can't help but be aware of what is going on.  Like anyone going to indy shows will 99% of the time be industry diehards so your comment was...odd.  Your roomate has solid taste.
r/nhl, knock knock mother fuckersThis here is why nhl playoffs can be watched by any fan whether or not there team is in it. This is also why nba playoffs are bullshit. All #1 seeds dont sweep and absolutely demolish their opponents.  Only way nba can compete with this is by cutting their salary cap in halfThe very worst thing that could have happened to the Canes is what happened the moment that goal was disallowed.  Angry Russian Machine, is a victorious Russian Machine, and 8 is going to be positively foaming at the mouth.  RMNB.tHe PlAyOfF fOrMaT iS bRoKeNHow dare you.Room 4, Room 5, Room 6, Room 7....The Reaper is about to get knocked the fuck outOvi is waiting behind the door with the right to knock him the fuck out.Russian Machine Don‚Äôt BreakLet's be honest here. If the rules were called the same as in the regular season, most upsets would not be possible. The high-flying, high scoring teams would still be lighting up most opponents because they would not be getting hooked, slashed, tripped and grabbed without penalty.‚ÄúWhat do we say to death, not today!‚Äù Go caps!Should have made the room number 4,5,6,7Tampa lost in 4, Calgary in 5, Nashville in 6, Washington going into 7 üëÄGrim reaper should have a stripped shirt if it‚Äôs coming for the Caps.Go Canes!  Conquer those Caps!Has there ever been a playoff where all 1 & 2 seeds were eliminated in round 1?OuchI am now 0-4 in series of games go wrong for me tonight and Vegas and Boston win idk what I‚Äôll dolet 'em be savedNo noMy 3 NHL Brackets:  NHL League: Tampa  College League: Calgary  NHL Hockey: San Jose  I have to hope the Sharks win today.You're that land shark!Home ice has been the key. I‚Äôm counting on us to pull through.# Capitals better not open that door!!!!!I‚Äôm a huge NBA fan but I‚Äôve completely stopped watching the first round of the playoffs and started watching the Stanley cup playoffs. 3 first round series going into game 7s and the best team in the league getting swept has turned me into a hockey fan.IMHO Dallas was just better than Nashville that seriesThis post aged well.Preds were left seeing Stars after that seriesLet's go Isles! Rip their fucking heads off!!!lots of pretenders this year.nobody's home*cheerfully oblivious* Whooooo is it??knock knock... it‚Äôs the United States...nba is trashOr just enforcing their salary cap in a way that makes sense5 teams won the series in under 5 games while NHL has 3 game 7s lmaoThen the owners just made all that extra money? Hard disagree. The nba just makes more money than the nhl so more flows to the players. That‚Äôs how it should be.No, the way to fix the NBA is to get rid of max contracts. The stars would be more reluctant to make super teams if they could sign contracts for what they were actually worth instead of the league placing an artificial cap on their earnings.I don‚Äôt think the cap is the issue. Due to inflation, players would end up at these numbers regardless. I personally think that the game of basketball as it stands  is fundamentally flawed. In hockey, you need all 22 of your players to show up and play. Granted stars cans still be stars and win games but overall it‚Äôs a big effort. Basketball seemingly has an issue where all you need is 3 really good people. I personally think that if the game allowed live substitutions like hockey,  even for a drive or 2. Then teams would have to spend more on depth players.   I get that the players make stupid money, but in theory cutting the salary works if they don‚Äôt give up month to keep winning. If they keep getting paid the same percentage of the salary, the same issue arisesI know right. As soon as the pivotal game tying goal got disallowed and gave my team back a 1 goal lead i was like "this is the worst thing that could have happened"Yea the worst thing ever is having a tying goal with 8 minutes left disallowed. Smh.NBA fans?No but it is thoI don't think "all division winners after 82 games get knocked out first round" is the argument you think it is.   There should be a balance between the best teams moving on with possibilities of upsets and Cinderella's. Both the NBA and NHL have sort of had the type of playoffs the other side memes about.Are people discussing this elsewhere.  I think it's interesting.  Parity in the NHL has been fairly high for years now.  I think that's a good thing, but it makes getting a top seed less than important.  It seems to me that as parity goes up, the size of the playoff system needs to drop- and vice versa.This doesn‚Äôt prove the playoff format is broken. No one cares about this part. The problem is when two top 4 teams (see 2017) meet in the first round.No way! Jerk train !!!! ChoooChooo motherfuc****Too bad Caps let their elite coach go because they didn't want to pay 4 mill lol. Now they're in game 7 vs Carolina lol*Ovi opens the door ‚ÄúPrivet‚Äù *Reaper ‚Äúnope fuck this I don‚Äôt get paid enough  I‚Äôm out‚ÄùHeyyyy!! Isles have Trotz now! How are the caps doing??? :))I don't think it's as cut and dry as that, but it's definitely something that's hard to argue.And that's why I think that something needs to give. The rules either need to be enforced the same or acknowledged officially as being different.  I'm OK with either, really.If we are being honest, the change in style of play of playoff hockey would result in a penalty being called about every other minute. Turns out it's really easy to make an infraction when you're giving 110% every shift when you're on skates.  Penalties almost *have* to be called less in the playoffs.Yeah they should really let them play in the regular seasonLet‚Äôs take the CBJ series as an example. CBJ only took 6 penalties and killed 5 of them. They were the second least penalized team all season. Then when TBL gave them 10 PPs they capitalized on 5/10.   So you want more penalties called so CBJ can shut down even more of them?Lightning series in a nutshellYup, it'll have to wait for tomorrowBig oofwith the NHL's help, how can you lose?!That call last night was complete bullshit. That was a goal!I mean, this is the first time all #1 seeds were knocked out in round 1> Let's go Isles! ~~Rip their fucking heads off~~ Win game 7!!!I think the parity in the nhl is just insanely good.Shit hide yo oil. We coming for itYea no reason the 3rd man off the bench in the nba whose a career 10pt 1 assist per game guy makes as much as guys like auston matthews and tavaresWell i meant in the way of competition. The 8th seed has no shot of beating a 1 seed in nba. You can just see the skill gap in the teams and unless thats addressed, nba playoffs will always be garbageYou could argue the same thing about the NHL cap, no?Pens fan that lived near DC....a pissed Ovie sometimes was what I wanted, there's a certain level of pissed Ovie that just destroys the team and I love it. Now as a Pens fan in SC, hoping for a W for you guys.If it‚Äôs equalized there Williams goal doesn‚Äôt happen. Then the empty netter doesn‚Äôt happen. Either another goal is scored in regulation or it‚Äôs OT. It made a huge difference.I‚Äôm loving it so farIt really isn't at all. Compare it to every other sport and how they do things and hockey probably has the best system. Now that doesn't mean it has NO flaws, but it is so far from brokenYou can curse man. We won't tell.Ovi's gonna open that door and smash his skull before he has a chance to move.You should work on the creativity of your burner account names, Mr. Trotz...Caps would have had to BEAT $25m over 5 years... not many coaches are making that in the NHL, and while Trotz had just won the Cup with the Caps, he'd also had numerous early playoff exits.   Say the Caps had given him what he wanted monetarily, and the Caps failed to make the ECF with him at the helm, would that be acceptable to you as the Owner?Did he say elite?!In which game was coaching the issue?Actuallyyyyyyy, Mr. Trotz you opted out if your extension and decided to leave.  I‚Äôm surprised you don‚Äôt remember that.What happened to the Lightning after having the season they just did had little to do with what was just described.Tampon Bay.  Only good for one period!you must not be watching lolHave you actually watched a game of the series or are you just parroting every salty Caps fanIt appeared the goalies pad was pushed into the net.interferes with his pads, therefore clearly not a gaol lol 69.3NOPE!!!!!   Washington/Carolina plays game 7 tomorrow,so you are wrong at the moment and have a 50/50 chance of being vindicated.And that‚Äôs what makes a sport so amazing right? What fun is it watching the patriots or GSW win every fucking year? Hockey is great because it‚Äôs similar to combative sports...as good as someone is...they can always get knocked the fuck out!Well, that‚Äôs just the market. There‚Äôs a lot more basketball fans than hockey fans, and basketball is significantly cheaper of a sport to produce when you consider the team size and equipment etc.Apples and oranges. Money that the other 3 leagues bring is in a totally different ballparkThat‚Äôs a fair point and I agree but just cutting the salary cap only hurts the players and enriches the owners.No. The whole point of the post I was replying to is that the NHL doesn‚Äôt have this problem.Thanks i appreciate it lol, im in SC as well. But yeah he got tossed at the end of the game for being too emotional and clapping when the ref called a penalty on him. The caps might win game 7, but its not going to be because ovi turned into the hulk like people say he willPizzas here!Do you want me to send Evgeny Svechinkov to your house? Is that what you want!!!!?Lol this is my main account I don't have any othersIf he didn‚Äôt end up panning out, they could easily just fire him and pay the money owed... they have the cash. Thats a risk im willing to accept on their behalf for a HoF coach who led us to our ONLY CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER 44 YEARS. And the only one in DC in 28 or whatever. I think they were dumb af.   That being said, Rierdan has done pretty well and if they lose I don‚Äôt think it would be his fault...It‚Äôs a gamble I think the team should have taken on.  As the Caps are now in a game 7 against a team they beat 6 times in the regular season with every chance to be sent home, Trotz has taken an Islanders team predicted by many to be amongst the worst in the league through Pittsburgh in 4 games and has been off for a week waiting for their next opponent. Trotz is looking worth every damn penny right now and has to be loving watching the Caps struggle against an inferior opponent.This.Because the caps would only pay him like 1 mil a year now he gets four"Salty Caps Fan", that's cute...  But, i admit you could say our confidence in the league to rule fairly on ANY series in which we participate has been suspended...   unlike Warren Foegele who fucking crippled Oshie with impunity...  So why don't suck my Salty #$@%?No, both the Lightning and Flames are out. They are the #1 seeds. Caps were #2 seedCut the cap and use all that extra as salary bonuses to the 2 teams in the finals or maybe even the semifinalsHaha Go For It.   I'm in Durham, short trip, he'll be flat on his back waiting for the ambulance.WhooshSeriously Trotz being fired is gonna look bad if they never win againüòÇüòÇ I can taste the salt in this postThere are 4 #1 seeds. The NHL plays a divisional format.So an even smaller group of players gets more money? I think you‚Äôre searching for a solution to a problem that doesn‚Äôt really exist.üòÇüòÇüòÇ r/iamverybadassTrotz wasn't fired. His option was activated with his cup win and he declined it. He had a deal on the table that the team couldn't say no to, it was his option to accept or decline.Well if cap is cut, super teams wouldnt exist and it gives bonus to teams who work hard to get to finalsWhat can I say, I like my chances against a 19 year old with a concussion.There will always be dominant teams in a sport where 1-2 great players can take over a game. That has been the case since long before we entered the era of insane salaries.Lol that‚Äôs Andrei, and he would still fuck your bald fat ass up. The one mentioned above is his brother üòÇdefinitely not bald, nor fat.   &#x200B;  If there's 2 things that Rugby backs are known for, it's their exquisitely coiffed hair, and their fitness.   &#x200B;  Nice try though.Lol keep typin on that keyboard there champüòÇüòÇüòÇ r/justneckbeardthings
r/nhl, You gotta imagine that growing up in Russia, Ovechkin was this kids idol. Getting KOd by someone you‚Äôve looked up to your entire life has got to be crazy.[A much better look at the fight](https://youtu.be/ZbqjM3Y7XyU?t=94)Clip is too short, he kept chirping at him and agreed to throw down. It‚Äôs a mistake he will never make againRussian machine never breaks, Russian machine breaks youI‚Äôm amazed this was only OVIs 4th fight...and first since 2010I like the strategy of using your head to potentially break their best players handDamn what was he thinking? OVE has a inch or 2 on him, 30lbs easily and old man strength (not an old man but the silver hair makes him look older).  Guy doesn‚Äôt fight much for good reason, who wants to fight this guy? Reminds me of a bigger Iginla.Fuck with the bull, you get the hornsthe confirmation that he wanted to get his ass beat as a 19 year old...respectChrist, Ovi, that man has a family!!can anyone add GTA "Wasted" at the end? would be the perfect touch.Don't start none, won't be noneOvi has that old man strength.Svechnikov getting ready for fencing Tokyo 2020.   On a serious note, hope he‚Äôs alright.A have a feeling Svechnikov will not make this mistake againArrest Ovechkin for child abuse.Went down quicker than the spire on Notre Dame cathedral. To soon?I could read some of their lips right before fighting and Svechnikov goes ‚ÄúDavai‚Äù right before he starts throwing.I had no idea Ovi could chuck em like thatI find this is a better angle of it, you can see Ovi just hit him square in the face before the knockout:  https://youtu.be/GrSRaHMMiWA?t=41Crosby still a bitch!Nothing but respect for svech*Russian Anthem earrape plays*Yeah I think he was feeling too big for his britches. It sucks about the helmet thing because KOs like this don‚Äôt usually happen but I understand they‚Äôre just trying to protect the players. I remember Parros bouncing his face off the ice in that fight with Colton Orr and that was definitely fucked upThis is what they call a Bad Business Decision.  Tale of the tape:  Svechnikov - 6'3", 187lbs  Ovechkin - 6'3", 237lbs  I feel bad for Svech, but two Russians fighting each other in the NHL is more than we all think. Only Ovi's 4th career fight but hes a sturdy tank, AND has a 50lb advantage and way more hockey sense. It looks like Svech didnt even hit him once!  Svech was riding high, scoring goals in the first game and had a fair lead in this game, and probably was feeling pretty untouchable. Svech wanted to go.  Theres another angle where Svech is trying to get up, and his helmet is over his eyes and his visor fogged.   I hope Svech is ok. No doubt Ovi feels bad.I love hockeyThe only thing exciting for a Caps fan in the gameOvi is a beast. Hope Svechnikov is ok, seemed to hit his head pretty hard.Ovechkin beat the shit out him. Dude totally asked for it thoughThis is as close as you can get to watching a father beat up his son.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.Kid didn't stand a chanceCan‚Äôt take on the OvechKINGOvie: we're getting destroyed tonight... I hope that svech kid comes at me   Svech: let's fight comrade!  Ovie: *gloves already off* good luck kid!Am I the only one who doesn't consider this bout as lopsided as everyone is making it out to be? Yes svech got KO'd, but after watching it over and over, that only seems to be because Ovi landed one first.  Andrei landed one just before Ovi but it looks like it hits the visor. Clear win for Ovi obviously but I have a ton of respect for this kid after this.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.When I hear people criticizing OV, I always wonder what the reaction would be if OV was the one that got knocked out...May it be a lession learned respect your elders and dont pick a fight you cant winStraight up murder right thereI want the Caps to win to see another epic Ovi celebration. Pretty sure he was drunk for 2 monthsMomentum changeFighting Ovi is really dumb, he could hold his own against some tough customers Russian or not.  Svechnikov needs to pick his battles more wisely.I was watching that with my dad at dinner and we both shot up when we saw it and screamed ‚Äúgo Wilson!‚Äù And then we were like ‚Äúwait what the hell thats ovie that canes guys screwed up big time‚ÄùI'm surprised Ovi took him up on it. Wouldn't think that would be worth the risk for a leading forward. Not sure what he had to gain from this.Was there. Surprised he skated off. It looked really bad.Looks like he‚Äôll have eyes to match his jersey next game.Svech was chirping ovi and agreed to throw downWatching my 19yo rookie teammate going for ove would of make my hella hype. Taking one for the team winning or loosing, thats dedication to the team. Cains better win this one for the kidYou know when they immediately start waving over the trainer from the bench, it's not a good situation.Fair play to Ovi, he stopped pretty quickly...before the linesmen intervened even.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Great KO.Keep the hot lap going OVI!That's not Ovechkin, that's andre arvloski in a hockey jerseySilly kid, no more playoffs for him. Rod Brind'amour looked pissed.LEGENDARYAs a caps fan that was the only good part of game 3Wtf was that kid thinking, never mind the natural strength difference between a teenager and a 30 year old, but Ovie's got to have close to 50 lbs on him.What on earth was he thinking?In Soviet Russia, the old man knocks you outThe fall of the Soviet Union colorized - December 1991Now that's what I call getting rocked like a hurricane....[Washington Post: Alex Ovechkin knocks out Carolina rookie Andrei Svechnikov in surprising bout](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/16/alex-ovechkin-knocks-out-carolina-rookie-andrei-svechnikov-surprising-bout/?utm_term=.d78aa7f247d6)[https://media.giphy.com/media/RlrBBrBdSTx8Ww0FOP/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/RlrBBrBdSTx8Ww0FOP/giphy.gif)HOLY FUCKThis guy russians.It looks like Svech was play hitting, while Ovi was going full force.Apparently ovechkin was chirping all game before the fightTalk shit get hit !!!Geno coming for him next year. #LGRW  IDamn I got excited I thought you meant ovechkin got knocked outCrazy, man I thought the other guy was gonna Win he payed so manyDamn, looks like us canes fans get the final laugh getting to knock Ove‚Äô and the Craptials out of the playoffs. Wooo hooo! Fuck the caps!You gotta remember Ovi is 47. Let that marinate a little.A 33 year old vs A barely even 19 year old kid. Kinda pussy if you ask meKO'd by Ovechkin... it might to be time to find a new job.How has nobody on Carolina attempted revenge???Stupid taking on a rookie like that. Of course he knocks him out. Doesn‚Äôt make him a man, he looks like an 19 year old that beats the crap out of a 12 year old and feels so strong after. I hate him so much. Hope he gets KO himself. Stupid.This is why we should ban hockey fights, it‚Äôs a mystery why such a barbaric practice is still allowed in a civil society. Ovechkin should be charged with assault and put in jail or deported to Russia for this brutality. UnrealThe video doesn't show this kid challenging Ovi to the fight. He asked for it and he got it. Welcome to the NHL!Straight out of*Goon*.I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúnever meet your heroes‚Äù, but I didn‚Äôt realize that was because they might knock you the fuck out.He sure was looking up to him in the endThey do say never meet your heroes....Yo kid has got balls but was not ready. You don't egg someone on to fight and then not be ready. The second he asked for a fight Ove dropped gloves and got both hands on him in one motion and then yakned him down into the punches. thanks for posting the full replay.Thank youGod this commentary is so much better than the first video I watched. Must have been Carolina home feed or something. Accusing Ovechkin of slamming his head into the ice and calling him a dirty player.Dudes a secret Soviet spy/killer...gah-dayum!!!Ove was entirely in control of that fight from the start. Once he engages with Svechnikov you could see Ove had complete control.This reply shows what REALLY happened. Svech deserved it 100%%%%%% I'm not even a caps fan... But this was just picking a fight with a veteran player and paying for it.That is the best footage. you can clearly see the kid nod that he wants to do this.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.r/suddenlycommunistThey're both Russian.Ovi plays hard, physical game, but he's clean.i mean very rarely will u ever see the team captain fightWho else did he fight and is there video?If you can‚Äôt break their spirit, break their body Nearly 50lbs. Svechnikov-187 Ovechkin-236Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.Had, that man had a family...BAAWWWGAWWD!Nah. Old Man strength is what Jagr is showing. Ovi is a damn machine.Recently had a kid. That's just dad strengthHe'll show up at the retirement home in 30 years and pick another fight. Just wait.A little morbid piece of me hopes he does.She said she was 19 manCathedral put up a better fightbuddy I was texting with said the same thing lolToo*YesConsidering that took several hours...?Way too soon dude. Assuming you're a civilian of the Western world, your cavalier attitude towards something like that is concerning. And this is coming from a very politically incorrect personWhat does ‚ÄúDavai‚Äù mean? Let‚Äôs go bitch?Ovi has been in 4 fights in his career, Crosby has been in 9. Not to mention Sid has played less games. who sounds more fight-averse to you?He'd apparently been slashing and making dirty hits on Ovi throughout the year in their meetings as well...   &#x200B;  At some point, you've gotta think a teammate would say "Hey Svech, check Ovi's height and weight"Nah. The only reason Ovi got pissed off enough to fight him was because Svech kept slashing his wrist. Svech played a stupid game and won first prize.Dude got wrecked. Looked more like a cocky teenager to me that got shown what the real world looks like.I doubt he feels bad. However, being a fellow countryman, Alex probably checked on him after the game and likely gave the kid props for doing what a lot of other guys wouldn‚Äôt do, even though it was a terrible idea.   Russians are the only ones who will have a go with him(Malkin) (Radulov). I think there‚Äôs some super weird respect dynamic that comes with their beefing.I love hockey as wellWorst playoff game I've ever seen from the caps in my time.Ovi drunk, in the fountains of DC with the Cup was AWESOMEUnfortunately, I think it played into hurricanes‚Äô hands. The knockout likely did more for Carolina effort wise than Washington. Or at least that‚Äôs what seemed to transpire.When even Reaves won‚Äôt fuck with Ovi, you know you‚Äôve got a problem if you‚Äôre facing him gloves off.When you can fight their leading scorer, the risk / reward is as about as high for a fight as can be. I'm more surprised he agreed to it.I jumped off the couch cause you don‚Äôt miss a rare Ovi fight up close and dvr‚Äôd on repeatSvech going after Wilson would be an even worse idea.attempting to swing the momentum of the game... the Caps came out flat, and never seemed to wake up.   &#x200B;  The Canes are very good about putting their foot on the throat of an opponent when they get a lead.He's gonna miss some games judging how hard his head was hit and his body's response...he was out hard.He'll likely be out for a week or two.      This series will be over in 5 anyway.The announcer on CNBC was yelling for the trainer like 2 punches in.He‚Äôs 33.Just started watching hockey eh bud? Everyone is a grown up on the ice, you wanna fight then they‚Äôre gonna fight.Good thing you‚Äôre not a professional critic. I didn‚Äôt know they checked IDs before a fightThat's not a failure on the guy's part. Ovechkin doesn't fight because no one wants to fight him not because he isn't a good fighterthey dont have to. Caps havent gotten a shot off in 30 minutesKid started it, no sympathyTwo professional hockey players going at it is a bit different than a 19 year old beating up a 12 year old.Svech was chirping ovi and agreed to throw downlolYou can see in the clip the kid obviously said let's go to Ovi. Sometimes you get what you ask for. Your up and have momentum and you pick fight with a guy way bigger than you...sounds more like a rookie mistake to me.Haha I knew I'd find a stupid comment ittPenguin fansI'm just going to assume you aren't a hockey fan and came to this thread because you stumbled upon it, because you really don't understand hockey culture.What about boxing and MMA?I agree. I‚Äôm sure a lot of Canes fans are salty, even though they‚Äôre up by 3 now. My buddy asked me why Ovechkin would do it, too... as much as I can‚Äôt stand Pierre, he did say something really smart. They don‚Äôt ask to see your birth certificate in the NHL. The moment you step on that ice you‚Äôre a man just like everyone else - regardless of age.You can see Ovi's restraint, too. He stopped throwing as soon as he saw the guy was KO'd. One of the casters mentioned that was only Ovi's fourth fight in the NHL. He plays a clean, respectable game.  Edit: a lot of people have pointed out to me that Ovi isn't an example of 'clean'. Upon review of some Ovi YouTube vids, you're all right, he's not cleanest, not the dirtiest player. But he was honourable in this fight.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.Saw the whole video, my buddy linked it to me from Twitter. You're definitely right.You want the heat, you get the heat!To be fair.. even taking those punches.. he is a hockey player... he will brag about it 20 years from now evenYou don't want none of Ross The Boss.exactly my thoughtsThe speed at which he dropped his gloves and got on svech was Jason Bourne-like.His left hand was gripping his jersey and he fell along with him.  Anyone who doesn‚Äôt see this doesn‚Äôt play hockey and know how balance and angles work on ice. I‚Äôve been playing for over two decades.  Ovi has had 4 fights his entire career, he‚Äôs not malicious.This clip was the DC home feedThat that other announcer was horribleCarolina commentators weren't even calling this game - it was nationally broadcasted.he literally held his collar with his left hand and bent him the whole way to the ground, support his weight and head.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.Ik but ovi is the russian machineRussian machine break Russian and non-Russian alikeSo you think fighting is dirty?https://capitalsoutsider.com/2019/04/15/a-history-of-alex-ovechkins-fights/Awwww he's just a baby!!!He'll probably go after Kuzy next.Yo that church was lit famLol not buying you‚Äôre a very politically incorrect person.Relax. I was just making a joke. I was just looking at the news and marveling at the beauty of the cathedral. This is /r/hockey and not the source of perfect political correctness.Lol you seem pretty PC to me guyGet over it gimpNo, it means ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚ÄùI respect the shit out of Cindy, but Ovie would knock him out too.Not many people wanna fight ovechkin for any reason. He's  a fuckin samsquamtch.Ovi has challenged Sid, and Sid shut up =/They have both been going at each other during every meeting this year, even more so in post season - it wasn't just svetch - lots of after hit slashing and pushing. Lots of Russian words.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen.Ovi definitely had him (no kidding lol) but these 2 have been sparring throughout the first 2 games. It was bound to happen. This kid is not cocky and probably his first fight. He didn't check the weight class. Ovi is a beast.Ok cool. ThanksBet you wouldn't step to Ovi like Svech didI agree. Ovie probably felt like that was the last resort, but needed to do it and respects the hell out of Svech for even considering a fight. Stand your ground, even if your ground is shaking before the gloves came off.I also love hockey as well.Consider yourself lucky. It was bad, but not the worst I‚Äôve seen in my fandom.I think Reaves would happily fight Ovi.Ovi's no fool, he knew he'd take the kid's head off.Oh yeah that would one punch and lights out probablyHe got hit so hard, ovi had to ice his own handHearing him call telling the trainer to get out there gave me chills. He knew the kid was fucked Up immediately. ‚ÄúYou gotta get out there, hurry up‚ÄùStill man someone should step up idk Carolina don‚Äôt they have any goons? This aggression will not stand manYou should feel some sympathy for anyone who gets KOd like thatOvi was chirping Svech the game before. The kid should have known better too. I‚Äôm not a Pens fan. Hated them for letting Matt Cooke play a couple years back...nah we aren't salty at all, this is hockey. It was just a dumb move by both parties. Svech for being an overconfident kid, Ovi for agreeing to it.Most people stop right away when they know someone is KO'd.This guy's brother vows revenge on Ovi.The canes broadcast was pretty upset and calling ovi dirty for "pushing" his head onto the ice after the KO. Just looked like murder.to meI actually saw ovi throwing the right punches to end the fight as quick as possible. He wanted the KO before he caused too much damage.Wouldnt call him an honorable fighter either... Didn't even let the kid get his gloves off before he started throwing.He may have restrained hi self in this fight, but he's far from a "clean" player. Maybe not outright dirty, but "clean" players don't leave their feet with the regularity of a Boeing jet. Ovi is a great player, but not "clean".Lol he does not. Almost every single hit ovetchkin throws he leaves his feet. They don‚Äôt call it though.He missed him with a haymaker as the kid goes down. Wtf you watching bro. League should fine him for driving the kids head into the ice.Fightwise maybe clean, but his plays are definitely not! Refs also love to turn a blind eye to his shit. Love him, but can't mark him as cleanlink?Wilson does the same thing in fights, and they both have been "attacked" for it, but if a fight is agreed, why would you wait around for the other guy to be 100% set and ready? That's just stupid.   &#x200B;  If you're getting in a fight in the NHL, you want it to be decisively over, ASAP, with minimal damage to your hands, eyes, and jaw.He has the Soviet Strength of his forefathers[https://youtu.be/paG1-lPtIXA](https://youtu.be/paG1-lPtIXA)Exactly. It's just Ovi is THE MachineRead it again? I'm not sure your brain is working. Does it say "fighting is dirty" anywhere?I think he'll still get smashed.Last time that happened, Tom Wilson had words with Ian Cole.Couldn't be further from it. You may not have family in Paris but I do so I know what's really going on outside the media blackout of these incidents and view this differently. Christian churches have been targets of arsen and vandalism for months now. The 2nd largest in Paris was burned 2 weeks ago. This was no accident or laughing matter. Stay informed. Back to hockey2/3 ain‚Äôt too bad. It looked like Ovi asked if he really wanted to go that route first.I don‚Äôt know about that. It would be a good fight. Rumor has it Crosby puts up 300+ on the bench pressAnd then had a goal and an assist in a 2-1 gameI think it‚Äôs pretty clear Svechnikov made the wrong decision.I, too, love hockey.Damn. When was worse?He certainly didn‚Äôt take him up on that for 5 straight games.You‚Äôre right that the aggression won‚Äôt stand. The kid started it, and he surely wasn‚Äôt standing after it.The guy shouldn't have started fights that he wouldn't win.So many people in here must have just started watching hockey. No sympathy, the man chirped his way into a fight and got clocked...if anything I respect him.if you watch the full video ovi literally asks him if he wants to go and he agrees, ovi doesnt do this all the timeWhy was it dumb for Ovi to agree? Guy had been sticking him all series. Hindsight, it definitely didnt give them the pick me up they were looking for though thats for sure hahaKid got what he had coming to him. Got the storm surge knocked out of him.Most... the UFC is a bit different.Khabib gonna hope the ice and jumpkick himThe Canes broadcast crew is one of the most over-the-top homer crews in sports.   &#x200B;  Can't stand them when I'm watching games as a neutral, even worse as a Caps fan.If anything, it looked like Ovi was protecting the kid's head.This game wasn't even called by Canes broadcasters. It was nationally televised.Jets don't have feet and as far as Boeing jets, they seem pretty attracted to the earth as of late.We have found the Penguins fan here.You mean the people he is hitting leave their feet.It's fine if you leave your feet after contact is made, which is why he doesn't get called.He didn‚Äôt drive the kids head into the ice wtf you talking about, the dude fell and he was holding him so he started falling too, it‚Äôs not like he grabbed the dudes head and smashed it into the ground on the way downHe pulled the punch.https://mobile.twitter.com/NBCSCapitals/status/1117937848357879809?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet  Someone linked a YouTube here that was good in showing it all tooI disagree with you. I can see where you‚Äôre coming from, but it‚Äôs a little cheap in my eyes[Brett Kreisher would like a word](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA)I‚Äôm just trying to figure out the point of your comment, irrelevant at best.Who have the arsonists been with the other churches?  Seems news I‚Äôve been getting today is 100% an accident likely due to renovations.  What is the real story?Yeah it was hard to read his lips since his back was to the camera most of the time.Quick google says there's 16 kilos (34-ish pounds?) difference in mass, and there's safe assumption that both Sid and Ovi are pretty well-built.  With difference in mass like that, unless Crosby is LEAGUES ahead as fighter, Ovi's chances are significantly higher.Crosby is a GOD at hockey but not at fighting.We're not talking about scoring, we're talking about fighting. Sid didn't take the fight, and stopped talking. (Stick man shrugging shoulders)Maybe, but you gotta respect it at least a little bit. At least he wasn‚Äôt afraid of getting his ass beat. More than most people on this sub can say. It‚Äôs hard to fight knowing you‚Äôre probably gonna loseRecent memory? When the Caps fought the Pens to a game 7 after being down 3-1 and losing showing no heart. It wasn‚Äôt a complete blowout like last nights game but it stung a lot worse.  Edit: probably made it worse that I was at that game.Reaves only fights when it's necessity.  He's trying to draw penalties, which he's kinda good at.  As a sharks fan, I thoroughly dislike him.Because he is undoubtably a top 3 goal scorer of all time if not the best and repeatedly punching people in the face can hurt your hands.They've been at each other all series, Game 1 Ovie was slashing at Svech and then Svech gave it back, then this game Svech was the instigator, probably because they're both russian and Svech feels he needs to prove himself. But Ovi isn't a fighter (I believe this was his 4th fight), he has way more to lose in that scenario, broken hand, something going wrong and getting tossed. He's not wrong for fighting, nor is svech, but Ovi had more to lose there as the veteran.I don‚Äôt think he was expecting Ovi to go that hard.I may be wrong, but I think in UFC you‚Äôre supposed to keep going until the referee stops the fight.MMA in a whole is different, ref‚Äôs job to stop the fight, not the fighters.Trip and Forslund are definitely characters, but it's just as bad for the caps crew too.Lol okay buddyTo be fair, about 10 years ago this is what every Canadian nationalist said about ovechkin.Nope I‚Äôm a masochist (Oiler fan)Ok so it‚Äôs the jumping into contact? Thanks for the clarification.The best part of this clip is how fast they started and stopped ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna knock you out‚ÄùAs soon as you agree to a fight, thats when the fight begins. Would you fault a drag racer for starting earlier than their opponent?I do see both sides of the argumentNah. He's the Fattest Man Alive, Burnt Chrysler.Just in case you're not trolling, RealisticCount is implying that if you're a dirty player, you will likely piss off more opponents and get into more fights.  If you play clean, you will have less enemies and will get into less fights. Therefore, having less career fights is one sign of somebody that plays relatively clean most of the time.  I didn't think it was super hard to figure out the point of the comment but there you go.Jesus fuck, why do I bother with this sub. You must be Leafs fan.This very church was attempted to be burned in 2016 by some men from....let‚Äôs say somewhere East and they were just charged this week. If you believe this was an accident, at 6:45pm after work hours, during the Holy Week, in Paris....I don‚Äôt know what to tell yaIm not trying to defend Crosby or anything. Im actually a red wings fan, but a lot of fighting has to do with technique and balance. I would give the slight edge to Crosby in terms of skating ability/ edge work. I still think Ovechkin wins the fight because he‚Äôs got the height/ weight advantage, but it would be a good one and would be talked about forever.God? Maybe a saint. But shit he ain‚Äôt no hockey godThat exchange was awesome. Sid was yelling at Ovi saying he shouldn‚Äôt have Wilson fight Oleksiak for him if he didn‚Äôt like the hit, then Ovi challenges Sid to fight. Sid promptly shuts the fuck up because he knows what‚Äôs good for himNot sure I follow that argument. He would not have fought if he thought he would lose.I mean, he dropped gloves against Kane and certainly didn't need to.     People don't fight Ovi, because Ovi is a fucking monster.You‚Äôre forgetting Ovechkin can‚Äôt be injured, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô4 240lbs of Soviet steel. His hands are gigantic, no chance they break on that kid‚Äôs face or helmet.A hand can heal and its not a common issue for players like Wilson who fight all the time i dont think one fight every once in a while will do much harm.Valid point hahaYeah but they are both Russian.  They will drink some vodka after the game and boom, everything is all good.True. Also I've seen some fights where the guy looks totally done only to recover. Better to go until you get stopped, unless you clearly startch the guyI can do without Tripp but John is an amazing announcer. Even other networks have him calling their games like NBCSports throughout the year here and there, and a bunch during the playoffs. He is as solid as they come. Met him a few times and can honestly say he is a down to earth dude.Horrific analogyEXACTLY.   &#x200B;  Ovi is one of the hardest hitters in the league,  but they're almost always clean hits, and he doesn't goon it up.   &#x200B;  I'm glad TW43 is beginning to emulate him in that regard, while still also being the enforcer the Caps need.Lol okay kidSounds like cultural enrichment to me.Had my suspicions that this wasn‚Äôt an accident and with the media blackout, it speaks volumes as to what you are getting at.I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted for this, no way it‚Äôs an accidentWhich is one of the reasons fighting in hockey is great. They didn‚Äôt even need to fight and it got a trash talker to cut the shit.He also drinks Dr. Pepper on the bench so... RIP to everyone else. Russian Machine doesn‚Äôt give a shit about his hands.Can heal but missing games because you fought someone is a bad reason for an elite goal scorerWhen the fight is agreed to, thats when the fight begins, and it would be stupid to not immediately start trying to win the fight.  When the light turns green, thats when the drag race begins, and it would be stupid to not start driving immediately.  Maybe not a perfect analogy because drag racing is obviously way more dependent on starting first, but other than that, how am I wrong?Confirmed. Stupid. Likely leafs fan.It's difficult and scary for the ignorant to comprehend realityHe didn‚Äôt agree to fight until he throws a punch that‚Äôs the difference! He never gives any type of confirmation before he throws a haymaker.[removed]That isn‚Äôt true, you can clearly see Ovi nodding, almost certainly in response to Svechnikov asking if he wants to fight, just before dropping the gloves. They clearly were chatting and mutually agreed to fightOof dropping R bombs in 2019
r/nhl, Sounds like ESPN needs a Johnny Hockey.  ESPN is to sports like MTV is to music videos.Blue Jackets, not Blues.ESPN is getting ripped a new one.  I found the Daniel Tosh video absolutely hilarious where he FRIED them.   I literally can't even watch ESPN anymore because of their horrible coverage.Even in the winter, they find a way to talk about baseball more than the NHL. Posts thread making fun of ESPN's hockey coverage, credits wrong team. Nice try, ESPN employee.Sharks did this once, and espn had the worst comeback. I can't remember what it was though. But man, I hate espn. Fuck off espnhttps://twitter.com/_Happy_Gilmore/status/395573697152819200My proudest moment as a Preds fanThis is why I love hockey. Pretty much a spot-on reaction from most hockey fans. ESPN is unwatchable for me, and unless they actually start showing sporting events I care about, then it always will be. And I love sports.Whoever handles the Predators twitter account is hilarious, [check this out](https://imgur.com/OPLc8R3)Did they delete the tweet? I can't seem to find it.....I feel like Hockey is a sport I could get into.Yes. This was great. Blues??? or Bluejackets?This makes me extremely happy.Uncle Leo?It's Blue jackets and Perds, not Blues and Preds.Well, ESPN has to entertain somehow...That is spectacular.So much win!!!Barry Melrose gets his 3 minute piece most nights.. But Around the Horn and PTI are the only things worth watching in my opinion. Everything else is just not entertaining and tends to beat 10 athletes to death and then some.love being Canadian and having the honour of watching TSN, no shortage of hockey coverageThis was amazing. It's amazing how much sports one cannot watch in the United States.  Thanks ESPN.This is a test.[deleted]Is that a [Seinfeld reference](http://youtu.be/payDsNKcRKQ) by CBJ? If so the I <3 BJ. #lumbusBang on analogy.I thought good ol Barry Melrose was Johnny Hockey...Jacques HockeyConnor McDavid. Gotta be a sweet nickname for him next year.Is Johnny Hockey not Johnny Hockey? (Calgary's Johnny Gaudreau out of BC)When OP said Blues it had me confused. I was thinking St Louis not Columbus.Thank you. Haha!  Gotta give a the Preds for sticking up for my boys. The Jackets have had a horrendous number of injuries this season. Such a turn for the worse from last year...OP works for ESPN.Sorry about that! thanks for pointing it outAHHA! we found you espn!For a baseball/hockey fan, ESPN is the worstThis shit's on point. [Quintessential Tosh](http://www.sportingnews.com/sport/story/2014-11-12/daniel-tosh-rips-espn-comedy-central-lebron-james-johnny-manziel-sec-video)I'm not even that big of a Tosh fan but this was completely awesome.  I would've loved to see the looks of all the ESPN employees faces after seeing that.Yeah Tosh blasted them, that was pretty funny.Can you link me to this video?I'd rather hear about baseball than 24/7 NBA and NFL even when they're not even close to being in season.  Baseball and hockey get the least amount of coverage. Thank god there is Baseball Tonight, but even hockey doesn't have a Hockey Tonight or something.What baseball coverage? I didn't even realize they had a comeback. Sharks fucking roasted themThat's funny because usually with the Sharks it's the other way around...The bar isn't very high is it? I'm too old to follow twitter jokes. I'm not sure which one was the punch line.never mind, found itTesting Flair> This made me very sad. I thought we were going to do AMAZING this year and then boom, everyone is injured.   Or The Learning Channel is to learning.   edit Honey Boo Boo : Learning :: ?? : Sports      a) Steven A Smith     b) Skip Bayliss     c)Collin Cowerd     d) Dick Vitale     e) all of the aboveHe is a dollar store version of Don Cherry.I watched him play in the NCAA tourney and boy is that kid good.I dunno, does ESPN do an hour long special every time he wipes his ass?This made me very sad. I thought we were going to do AMAZING this year and then boom, everyone is injured. The bromance that emerged between you guys and Edmonton was pretty cute too.Orrrrrrrr they will have a strong 2nd half of the season like last yearNo problem, ESPN. No worries at all! Totally hilarious exchange!It's even worse for soccer fans. Covered like it's a joke and the sport is put down at random times.Hockey, yes. Baseball? No way. You have 3 months of uninterrupted sporting months during the summer. Baseball is literally the only thing on there. Except every 2 years or so based on World Cup (rightfully kicking baseball off) and the summer Olympics. Nah we got some coverage after the World Series. I think they showed the Giants spraying champagne. http://tosh.cc.com/video-clips/hfuztk/sport-science-0That's where I'm guilty. I follow the NFL like my girlfriend follows the Kardashians.   I am part of the problem. :/That sucks for you guys. Canada gets Hockey2night on one of the TSN's. But this is Canada of course there is a nightly hockey show. NHL network.. NHL tonite. on repeat hourlyI remember last year during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, they were talking about the upcoming NFL draft.  UPCOMING.Man I miss NHL2Night.  But it was still only 30 minutes, and only the US Army and SlimJim advertised.I think by baseball "coverage" any/everyone means Sawx and/or Yanks games being shown 2-3 times a week.http://i.imgur.com/oQoUjOI.jpg  So good.No, not at all....damn it.Yeah, I have no idea what is going on there either.  It's just some guy trying to make fun of the predators, and the predators Twitter account shuts him down One person replied to the Preds original tweet and the Preds offer rebuttal. The next tweet is another person responding to the first tweet and then the Preds with another comeback.HOW CAN YOU HATE ON DICKIE V BAYBEE!?Colin Cowherd is one of a few guys I respect on ESPN, solely for the fact that he is brutally honestYeah but mullet though.  He's got the mullet.They will need a crazy good end if the year to work back into contention. Here's hoping...Imagine waiting to see the one lacrosse highlight of the season...we shall overcome brother.Uninterrupted? We get soccer, Johnny Manzel, football camps, and whatever Lebron is tweeting about to deal with. Well, to be honest, ESPN only really cares about the Yankees and bosox.  ALL THE TIME they'll have "regional coverage" of (for instance) Boston v Toronto or Colorado v Arizona.  Guess which game texas is getting?  Even the Braves get shunted in Mississippi for the Yankees.  It's miserable.  Cardinals and Dodgers/Angels get good coverage too.  Fuck literally every other team, though.  And when they put boomer on golf?  Slit my fucking wrists.Then back to LebronTV! This made my day[deleted]YES. I remember getting beyond pissed off at that.Did you find the espn comeback?I don't even get the original joke. Why would San Jose rename their hockey team after a terrible movie?I  never know if I should read top to bottom or bottom to top... also I'm here from /r/all so I don't know what anybody is talking about anyways. THERES GONNA BE NO HOCKEY ON DISNEY EVER BABY, WITH A CAPITAL N. I disagree. I think Cowherd is an idiot. I don't have any thing in particular in mind, but every time I hear him talk, I just turn him off. He just likes to run his mouth. Fair enough.As a wings fan since I could walk, I loved watching their run against Pittsburg last season I used to get so pumped for that one play that would make a daily SC top 10 every year, then I stopped watching ESPN. Occasionally they still show some good NCAA matchups on their backup channels thoughOh man as soon as they started using their football crew for golf stuff was ridiculous.  They used to have a decent pair of guys and a couple around-the-course types for their golf, was it the masters this year where they just put all their personalities on it? Or was it one of the other tournaments.  I don't follow closely enough to remember the specifics.You live in the present,  the future is a utopia where hockey is king. I can't find it, but I'm willing to bet it was so terrible, they deleted it after they were roasted for that comeback. We're talkin bout hockey. Game played on ice with sticks. Lots of Canadians. Keep up. top to bottom.   Caps fan: doesnt dolly parton play for your team?  Preds: no, but thanks for trying  Caps fan: thanks for trotz   Preds: thanks for forsberg    fucking super-burn.ITS SUPER SCINTILLATING SENSATIONAL BAYBEE. ESPN U Saturday mornings when the season starts up again. Sadly, nobody else covers lax.Probably the masters.  I think they got the Ryder cup two years ago too and just annihilated that as well.  I mean SVP is probably their best dude for golf and he was doing like spotlight coverage of the British and interviewing guys on the range, which just blew my mind.Canada is the future.AMERICA, ARE YOU SERIOUS!? HE'S A DIAPER-DANDY!Player interviews are so dumb.  Especially in golf.  I hate watching golf in recent years because they only show like 3 shots then a 5 minute interview, then 3 shots and another interview.  It seems like it used to be much more focused on the shots, no matter how famous the guy was, whoever was hitting at the moment got on tv.  It is what it is I suppose.
r/nfl, [Comment with a mirror](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7qg5lv/highlight_no_vs_min_diggs_gamewinning_td_reception/dsrvvvg/)RIP 100 year old lady who I assume had multiple heart attacks over that last 30 seconds.Case Keenum even had a hard time believing what happened.I feel like Case Keenum‚Äôs initial reaction was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fucking believe that Case Keenum just did that.‚ÄùThis years Championship Game Quarterbacks:  Brady  Keenum   Foles   Fucking BortlesWas anyone else yelling ‚Äúget out get out‚Äù thinking he needed to get out of bounds so they could kick a fg?*VIKING NOISES*I‚Äôm speechless. Great game. How the hell do you whiff that tackle so badly?This is the least Vikings thing all time This is going down in history. how do you post this so fastHowHOLY FUCKING SHITWhat on earth was that saints DB doing? Whiffed the hit and took out his own teammate... Absolutely insane finish. [deleted]Marcus Williams? Hello?This is one of the coolest moments I've ever witnessed. Congratulations, Vikings. That was fucking awesome.Dude missed Diggs and blocked his own teammateThe most sensational end to a game I‚Äôve seen in years holy fucking shitHoly fuckWhat the fuck was that#WHAT THE FUCK!You know it was big when you get Joe Buck excited. WHAT THE FUCK  Edit: Mad respect for the Saints players who came back out for that last snap. That brain fart by Williams reminds me of Flacco‚Äôs mile high magic though. Gutted for Breesus. Go Bears!This doesn't get said very often, but good call Joe Buck you sumbitch THE VIKINGS SAVED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FANS SELF ESTEEM Somewhere Jeff Fisher is taking credit for that play. "I pretty much taught Case Keenum everything"[Mirror - ImgTC](https://imgtc.com/w/VgZoHE6)  [Mirror - Streamable](https://streamable.com/tlg5q)Can we all just appreciate Joe Buck for possibly having the best call of his career? Just the perfect amount of disbelief and excitement for this play. Labor and delivery nurses in Minnesota will be busy around September. European guy here, I was in a mad studying session for tomorrow's exam (its 3 AM here) and I just turned this on to take a break, even though I hardly watch any NFL. I might have just seen one of the most memorable plays in history havent I?4D chess on getting a TD instead of risking losing another season on a field goal.#IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE NFL FOOTBALL[deleted]**CAN YOU DIGG IT!?!?!?**Keep your damn eyes up and watch what you hit.#The "VIKINGS SUICIDE PACT" Is *Still* *Still* *Still* on hold. Thank you for your Participation!  /u/bjkmanOne of the worst defensive plays I've seen. Reminds me of Den-Bal a few years agoPerfect call by Buck there. Excitement, conveyed the play perfectly, then shut up and let the crowd do the talking. He's a different commentator than he was a few years ago.Wow I bet this play will have an impact on the game‚Äôs outcomeThis moment man. I can watch it over and over. You can feel the defeat of the Vikings crowd. Like an overcast hanging low over a gray city. They're all thinking "I can't believe this is happening again" or "we were so fucking close". Then, the ball from Keenum seems to loft on forever. Diggs is in a crowd. There are two defenders *right there* with him. That catch is pure magic. It makes my face tingle. Hearing the announcer yell "DIGGS" and hearing the roar of the crowd as he sails into the endzone. The triumph of holding up the ball to the crowd saying "Not this time. I brought you this." And then throwing his helmet to wherever it lands. This is why I watch the NFL. To watch this happen live is just exhilarating. All I have to say is SKOL.Don't let this distract you from the fact that Blake Bortles and Tom Brady have a combined 5 Super Bowl championships and 4 SB MVPs between them. Should be a legendary QB matchup next weekThat was legitimately one of the worst situational tackle attempts I have ever seen.   Need to bring him down in bounds, even out of bounds is a 45 yard field goal. Goes for the haymaker tackle with his head down and no arms.  Shoutout to Joe Buck for a good call on the play and not having a horrific voice crackWilliams: I'd like a crucial interception to set up a comeback in the 2nd half.  *Monkey paw curls finger.*And Drew Brees is let down againWilliams whiffed the tackle and took out the Saints player with the next best shot at making the tackle.

Just one of those plays that'll really stick in the history of the NFL.So are we allowed to stop the 'Joe Buck is an emotionless robot' circlejerk yet? Because that was a great callIT'S DESTINY.  THE VIKINGS DIDN'T CHOKE!  THE VIKINGS DIDN'T CHOKE!!! I don't want to be a stickler for the rules here guys but Diggs clearly gets an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the score for taking his helmet off. The XP attempt should have been from the 17 not the 2... we're gonna have to get everyone out again and re-kneel that from the proper spot. Sorry guys rules is rules.Would love to hear the local radio call on that play.   Edit: found it [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SaFn8cqBThI&feature=youtu.be) They showed her calmly taking a sip of her drink when everyone was losing their shit. Dude she's an almost 100 year old Vikings fan. Her heart has to be made out of steel.She should‚Äôve known better when the Vikings were up 17She just turned to dust and blew away.Millie is adorable!She left to get another screwdriver and missed the playMILLIE MILLIEOn one of the replays you can see him saying "Oh My God".    Haha, he had the expressions of some random dude placed into this situation and having everything work out "Holy shit! How did Case Keenum do that?!"  -Case Keenum probablyHe‚Äôs currently praying that he isn‚Äôt dreaming this after being knocked unconscious by the Saints pass rush.His press conference he still couldn't really believe it. People kept asking him about it and he basically was like "I just was trying to give my guy a chance and I threw it up and he somehow caught it"The camera on his face as the play was being made was in slow-mo and they replayed it afterwards and he actually says "OH MY GOD... WE WON?!" Sounds like it in his interview with Chris Meyers too.  "I can't even right now!"  :DHe did shit like that all the time at UH5 Super Bowl rings between themPlease dear god let it be Bortles and Keenum in the bowl Is that the 70th best current NFL QB, Blake Bortles?   Fucking Chris Simms...Yes! This is where I would have stepped off the sidelines, taken a small celebration and then stared at the open field from it.Yep. DIGGS WTF ARE YOU DOING GET OU-ohhhh... oh OH OHHHHH FUCKBoth my dad and I screamed "Get out of bounds....NO RUN!"The entire stateExactly what I was thinking. I figured there was a deep safety. What a bad attempt of a tackle. Why not just wrap up and end the game. This is why I wish there was an option to see the game from behind the QB like in Madden. I get that it distorts how far you are moving, but the down field action is the most exciting part. Yup! I assumed there had to be someone left to beat lol.WHO NEEDS A FIELD GOAL WHEN YOU CAN JUST GET A TOUCHDOWN###BARROOOOOOOYELLS IN MINNESOTANDIGGS IS RANDY MOSS REBORNHINGA DINGA DURGENHonestly. As a fan of neither teams I really enjoyed this one He tackled his own man!He used the hit stick instead of the tackle button didn't just miss the tackle, but took out his own guyonly explanation is that he didn't want to take a penalty for PI or defenseless playerLooks like he meant not to hit him#SNATCHED VICTORY FROM THE CLUTCHES OF DEFEATHe got there early and tried to avoid a flag by whiffing. Terrified of PIWhen will it be our turn to have the least Jets thing of all-timeAt half I told my fianc√©, if the Vikings lose this game now, it will be the most Vikings thing ever. I am so glad I was wrong. Here's a little lesson in trickery.He literally posted it before they could kick the extra point!BotsProbably didn't even have the written consent of the NFLWowWilliams zigged when he dun should have zaggedRahim Moore ghost can now go to restMEME TRAIN INCOMINGReminds you of Flacco? Cuz thats what this reminds me off. Brain fart by a safety, TDHe still thought he was playing against practice squad recievers>Whiffed the hit and took out his own teammate  Been playing way too much Rocket League recently, I see this shit happen all the time. Didn't think I'd see it happen in football.  What a save! I think he was scared that he was too early and it would be PI. Still stupid but at least there‚Äôs a reason thenare your pants okayBiggest whiff I've seen maybe in my life.  I feel terrible for him.   This is gonna be running through his head for months if not forever. HE GONEGah I feel bad for him. He fucked up big time, but shit I feel bad for himDarius Slay tweeted "43 got payed to miss that"  LOLTHIS IS LITERALLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS TO US!!!  IM STILL CAN'T EVEN!!!Complete moron for going for the big hit.  All he had to do was wrap Diggs up and the game is over.if he makes that tackle in bounds the game is overWalkoffWe just witnessed the birth of a classic. Yeah just what the fuckWilliams whiffed on a hit dafuq are you doingThat shit was worse than what i did against the ravensWhat the fuck is #43 doingI JUST PEED MY PANTSMarcus Williams with the worst play in NFL historyHello r/ALLDecades of bullshit being overcome. HE ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY WENT OUT OF BOUNDSWe won??VIKINGS NO LONGER CURSED#SHITTY TACKLING ATTEMPTI don't like Joe Buck and he gets a lot of shit, but I get chills every time I watch the replay and he screams "DIGGS!!" Great call for a huge moment. When you call verticals in Madden and your receiver jumps to catch and the defender can‚Äôt turn around to tackle,Just went through all human emotions in the course of a half. I wanna crawl in a hole and die right nowLol the punter was on defense for the last snap. They must've just grabbed the 11 guys closest to the entranceYou just had to bring up the Ravens-Broncos game didn't you?He's getting a lot better.  He's dropping the uptight, hyperprofessionalism and enjoying the games more, and it shows in moments like this. I actually enjoy him these days. Was fully ready to go lie down for a long timeJeff Fisher coached QBs are starting for both teams in the NFC championship game. Bless you and all your generations of knees.And he didn‚Äôt even have to say ‚ÄúAaron Rodgers‚Äù during it either!I need "Diggs - Sideline - Touchdown - Unbelievable" as my ringtoneEveryone loves to hate on Joe Buck but I think he's a decent commentator. He could be way worse.They'll be like 412 babies named Case? WTF?Yes.  It didn't decide a championship, but it's going to be replayed for years.The fact that case keenum made the pass makes it that much more amazing. He's been a so-so qb for most of his career but is just having an amazing run this seasonBlair Walsh died for this.I didn't like that and I don't like football anymore.I don't like it, but I respect it./r/unexpectedGrantNapier/r/kings is leaking#**VIKINGS WIN IT**Hate Buck but he did a good job on that TD play.  He actually sounded excitedSUCKAAAAAAAAAAYes we canSUCKAAAAASUCKAAAAAAA#SUCKANah man, close your eyes, lower your head and just kinda fall I really thought we were sealing that pact today. I was trying to explain to my housemates who haven't been baptized into Vikings pain that there was no way we were going to win this, for the entire second half, never mind when the Saints took the lead. I have never been more shocked in my life.Yeh and whats great is I didnt get kicked out of the bar for this one lolHe catches a whole lot of shit for how bad he was and not enough recognition for his improvement. He isn't the best but he's not ass anymore so good on him. We'll see. There's not much time left.https://mobile.twitter.com/ScottKegley/status/952738439413121024/video/1   Watch this one if you want a better idea of what it was like to be thereI hear Tom Brady and Blake Bortles have collectively been in 7 of the last 7 conference championships With the Vikings history a 45 field goal to win a playoff game is an assured miss. No problem if he would have tackled him out of bounds.I think he bailed last minute. Didn‚Äôt know if he was going to catch it or where the ball was. Didn‚Äôt want a PI. THE TRUE SAINTS DEFENSE HAS RETURNEDAs is traditionNumber 1 nowMissed the tackle and chop blocked his teammate as well. What a whiffRahim Moore: it‚Äôs me, Payton! Reminiscent of that Broncos DB that let Jacoby Jones by him a few years back.  https://youtu.be/HmRYZOuXHrAI can show you 10 plays in last year's super bowl that were worseThis will haunt him the rest of his career He was gonna be a hero with the interception that set up the touchdown and now he'll be remembered for tackling a ghostWho you taking? This guy or the guy who sent the end times message to Hawaii?[deleted]Coverage was fine. The tackle attempt was pathetic. How do you tuck your arms in and cannonball yourself in that spot?Not only did he fuck up extraordinarily bad in coverage, he took out the only other guy with a chance to take down Diggs. This sounds like a HUGE fucking claim...but it really might be.Keenum's throw and the Saint's throwM-A-R-Y-L-A-N-D. Maryland will winLet's goooooo MARYLAND *clap* *clap*Roll fucking terpsAh, trying to get to the top I see!They threw a flag, no idea why it wasn‚Äôt enforced.  You can see the flag in the end zone when they swarm Diggs.To be fair shes lived through like 8 wars at this point.  No tmuch phases her haha.https://i.imgur.com/7ZmdSlE.jpgShe was really enjoying being at the track watching the poniesIf Gary Anderson and Blair Walsh didn't do it, nothing willdeleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3586  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/96200)I literally said that simultaneously with him.So he looked like Case Keenum?Case Keenum's story should be an Adam Sandler movieI *need* the pats to lose, because Keenum or Foles vs Bortles for the super bowl would be the best. The entire Vikings fanbase is praying they don't wake up tomorrow morning to learn this was all one dream.it's like I thought he was Brett Favre for a minuteBortles has never lost a playoff game Hahahahaha  Oh fuck And their franchises And 8 losses in playoff games - 7 of them by CONFIRMED LOSER Tom Brady.About to be 6it shall be known as the Meme BowlThe "Anyone but Brady" BowlIf LeBron was QB and faced Jaguars in the SB...We had a kid in high school do that. He wasn't very bright, but he was 6'5" and fast as hell. His name was Wordell Wadds. Coach says, "Wadds, we're gonna throw it over this son of a bitch's head and all I want you to do is catch it and step out of bounds immediately. I don't give a damn what it takes"  CB falls down 5 yards back. Wordell catches a breadbasket toss wide open 15 yards from the goalline. He not only steps out of bounds immediately, just as coach threatened, but starts raising the roof cheering and celebrating. My exact reaction.I think he was thinking that himself. He spun around to try to get out of bounds and saw nothing but open field in front of him so he caught himself with his hand and turned upfield. "DUDE GET OUT OF BOU...."  "GOGOGO FUCK YA!"‚ÄúWhat are you doing???!!! Oh there‚Äôs no one left.‚ÄùLoved how it took forever to get people off the field for the final PAT/ 2-point conversion kneel.Calm down, head of Nixon. I hate the Vikings and I somehow enjoyed it Lol this is exactly the type of shit that would make me just hit the power button, and scream how ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù it is... except this is real life Clearly hit dive instead of deflect/intercept. Looks like a madden player glitch from the side view.The kinda moment that keeps you up late at night thinking what ifThat's so fuckling true. I've whiffed so many tackles in madden going for the big one instead of just holding my ground and making the tackle.Little did he know that he would be the one that makes the game-losing playThat might have had a chance to chase him down to at least save the touchdown Why even dive?and that guy actually had a chance to run down diggs before he was able to turn and run for the end zone. probably the worst possible move. The classic ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use your arms‚Äù defensive back strategy.I get that but he still clearly wanted to deliver a big hit. Just stand there and wrap him up in bounds and the clock essentially runs itself out. I think he was hoping they'd flag Diggs for making him look fucking dumb. Yeah you can clearly see that he broke on the ball and got to Diggs too early.  He was terrified of touching him and getting the PI.Seemed like he was more bothered about not committing the PI penalty than actually going for the hit. Literally couldn't even look at him lol. Honestly that was just absolutely horrible1970 If you want to be a villain number oneI baked a cake before they could kick the extra point.To be fair, I was able to take a shower and smoke a bowl before they kicked that extra point.Ow 100% my thoughts. This was even worseThis is what came to mind immediately Sanits fans i feel your pain.EVERYONE SELL YOUR VIKINGS CHOKE MEMES  SELL SELL SELLAs a Ravens fan, that was the first thing I thought ofProbably scared he would get a DPI, but that‚Äôs better than whiffing and letting them get a touchdownWow!  Wow!  Wow!  That's what I would have said at least.They were carted off his body[deleted]didn't get juked had his head down the whole way wtfNot only did he whiff the tackle, he fucking took out the only other guy capable of making the tackle Forever Some sports psychiatrist is going to buy a yacht off of that play.That guy turned 21 in September. How the hell do you get up in the morning after that one?I am so happy for you guys. Given all you've been through in the last few years, this is beautiful!He didn‚Äôt go for the big hit. He got to Diggs before the ball had arrived and didn‚Äôt want to draw a dpi which would‚Äôve stopped the clock. If you watch the replay he clearly ducks away to avoid hitting diggs as he jumps for the ball.Minnesota Miracle.Home fucking runThe Vikings only walkoff at homeBut seriously... what the hell marcus Williams? Just make the tackle A GAME TO REMEMBER FOR THE AGESBetween this and the Favre NFCCG, I wonder how much the Saints and the Vikings hate each other now and forever.#OH NEAUX SAINTS WHAT IS YOU DOING!!That dude is going to be reliving that 5 seconds for the rest of his life.he just makes that tackle and the game is over.  Why the fuck is he diving with his head downProbably the worst tackle attempt ever in context  Nowhere is safe lol well played HONESTLY tho, there are all the like "this player cost his team the game" moments, this is LITERALLY all on him, he had the EASIEST play to make, and blew itr/NFL opted out of r/all :/Not yet. But plays like this have been against the Vikings for their entire history. Yup. I predicted the Saints going all the way, but Minnesota deserves it. They have such a tortured past, I'm rooting for them going forward. No qualms whatsoever rooting for the Vikings. "WAIT...I HAVE DAYLIGHT TO THE ENDZONE?"lol can you imagine if he had went out of bound and then the Vikings missed the FG? Entire state of MN would probably have given up on football forever.In my head I was like OMG GET OUT OF BOUNDS but he just kept running Username checks output the bleach downYou're safe for at least another week!I'm so fucking happy for you guys.for nowEven Joe Buck can't fuck up a play call this epicExactly what I thought ofLmao he pushed the hit stick a little too earlyüòÇliterally cheesedAnd takes out the only other defender who might have had a chance to stop it.What this reminds me of is when you play Madden and you're trying to take control of a safety to stop a bomb and go for a tackle to take out the WR but it selects the cornerback instead and you completely whiff on the hit stickthis but the exact opposite.Yeah, he's definitely lightened up.  I like him a lot now and enjoy him calling games.  I still hate aikman though. My jags jersey was sitting in the cart.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really amazing, Troy, what happens on the gridiron when you have an excellent quarterback like Aaron Rodgers watching this game from home. Case Keenum would literally be an impotent jelly roll on his wedding night if Aaron Rodgers wasn‚Äôt watching.  Wow. Aaron Rodgers‚Äù  - Joe Buck206 twins named Stefon and Case?  Even the twin girls?  WTF?I‚Äôm heartbroken and all I did was hop on the Saints bandwagon. That was rough. Try being a Texans fanHow much alcohol does it take to kill a 250 pound man? Asking for a friend [deleted]As a Kings fan, I‚Äôm so sad that doesn‚Äôt exist.- Ryan ShazierThe Saints out-Vikinged the VikingsI think you mean 8 of the last 7.Fuckin FLASHBACKS RIGHT HERE.  Sorry Saints fans, that one is gonna hurt for a LONG timeDidn't the broncos kneel down to end the quarter and go into overtime after that touchdown? You didnt need to bring the video into this man.... I don't think you can do worse, equally bad is possible though.I guarantee you can't. That was a textbook, easy tackle that you do every day in practice. All he had to do was make contact...He didn't even need to hit him though. All he had to do was wrap him up and keep him in bounds.Or the bottom ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)And she's been a Vikings fan that whole time. Sips tea, "We got this"Is it just me, or does she look pretty good for being 100?Im a 24 yr male in great shape. one year of walsh nearly did me in. she isn't human.Goddamn you Blair Walsh. Goddamn you for 2015 and that cold ass game. I still can't feel my fingers you fuck. Pretty much everyone did that. What an ending. Good luck next week. fuckin if that aint the whole truth of it alll!!!!I'm thinking prime Sandler in an aloof happy Gilmoreesque roleAnd Case makes a cameo appearance portraying Sandler 3/4 of the way through in a way that is completely unrelated to the plot.Also because none of those teams have won a Super Bowl before.  But, yeah, it would be the best!GOAT Bortles vs. Keenum. We need another Eli Manning. He really did look like Favre this game. Especially that roll out to the right and "fuck it I'm throwing it" across his body in the redzone.Unlike that scrub, Tom Brady.Keenum has never lost a playoff game No fucking way.Fuck you mean LeBron is literally our quarterbackHe'd be great in the armyWadds: did I done good coach?!  Coach: *sigh* yes Wadds, outstanding, out-f******-standingDude when Keenum was hyping the crowd starting the SKOL chant before the final kneel  So fucking powerful Not even a fan but seeing that stadium erupt and how emotional for everyone it got made me choke up a little.I'm a simple man, I see a Packers fan being a good sport, I upvoteFrankly Case Keenum winning the Super Bowl for them might be the scenario that amuses me the most Oh yeah, that would definitely end in a thrown controller.  The amount of times I've said this is bullshit when the Cpu pulls this off on third and long were just thumbed in my faceI‚Äôm still not sure if this is real lifeWell he knows now.That‚Äôs going to haunt him the rest of his life. Even if he caught up at like the 5 it would‚Äôve sealed the game. Williams fuuuuucked upEvery defensive back should see this 'tackle'. That's why you tackle with your arms. "I gotta hit *somebody*..."  *hits own guy*If the ball was just caught and Diggs knocked out of bounds, they're still in FG range with under 10 seconds. He probably thought he had to sell out to try and knock the ball loose. Bad decision, but he was probably trying to go big to jar the ball.This is it.  He's ducking before the ball even gets there because he thinks he's early.  And to be fair, there were 4 second left on the clock when the ball got there, so if he DID get flagged, it would've been a field goal set up.You have to chase a wide receiver on the runI saved $200 on car insurance before they kicked the extra point.I smoked a brisket before they could kick the extra point Kung PaoBUY CASE "BIG BALLS" KEENUM VS BIG DICK NICK FOLES MEMES! BUY! BUY! BUY!BUY SAINTS CHOKE MEMES NOW. r/falcons HAVE THEM ON SALE, GET EM WHILE THEY'RE HOOOOOOT!!!!!Real shame, they'll never be as explosive running the seam againPicsWhy not just contest the catch, he was in range for it. Instead he did almost the worse thing he could.Marcus Williams is like that pro wrestler who turns on his buddies and rips off his shirt to reveal he was in cahoots with their opponents the whole time.Forever is right. Especially if Minny takes it all. At least he can obtain the alcohol legally.you wipe the tears away with your millions of dollars, it doesn't fix it but it helpsBEST THING IVE SEEN ALL YEAR. Williams fucked the Saints BRETT FAVRE AND JARED ALLEN DIED FOR THISOn every montage of worst plays in NFL history Just wrap him up in bounds and gg. Games over. Not sure why he was trying to knock him in to next Tuesday.On the plus side, though, every NFL and college team got a video clip to use on every single defensive player who thinks big hits are better than proper tackles, because they're easier.Best decision any sub can make Sometimes they let it go through though.Joe Buck reverse jinxed you with the clips of past missed kicksHe was damn ready to get smacked.  TF was that DB thinking?As soon as he got it I immediately screamed out of bounds, not knowing he has an open field...This shit is when you try to play the ball and PRESS SQUARE accidentally then your dumbass DB dives to whereverI now am rooting for a Jacksonville - Vikings Super Bowl.I was feeling so bad for Minnesota.  Then I stopped and said, "I've seen the Patriots pull off crazy shit when I assumed a loss..."  Enjoy it. Minnesota has taken some bad beats over 20 years. I loved that 98 team.  Holy. Shit.Agree on both accounts.   Aikman is an annoying announcer cliche.Yeah not a fan of aikman and his watery eyes. Definitely not my favorite Cowboys commentatorExcuse meEw gross>As a Kings fan, I‚Äôm so sad ~~that doesn‚Äôt exist.~~  FTFYKarmic retribution.with 30 fucking seconds and 2 timeouts Not only did he not make contact, he took out his own teammate who might've had a chance.  What a fucking idiot*ic playWhich is WAY worse than being in a war I am sure.  Haha.She told Zimmer at half time ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt live this long to watch us blow this at the end.‚Äù  Zimmer ‚Äú I will not let the saints flim flam the Zim zam!‚Äù100 year old grandma to the Saints: "Omae wa mou shindeiru."Right, I dunno if it's the photo quality but she looks at least 30 years younger.Case Keenum. NFL MVP"Nah, I'll just beat them now" - Case Keenum, probablyAside from the memery, I really hope that a new team gets a chance. Fucking Tom Brady doesn't need another ring, and Pats fans don't need to get any smugger.I just want someone to win the Super Bowl for the first time. Unlike that scrub, Tom Brady. I'm here now. Legit ready to raid unsuspecting villages  Yeah he was enjoying having that power for the moment.  Pretty much going to get all his drinks for free for life on Minnesota and go down in Vikings lore.I agree, that'd be hilarious, let's do it.Case Keenum seems like an alright dude. Happy for him if not for the Vikings.He will always know.This is probably minimal consolation, but at least it was this game as opposed to the Superbowl or the NFC championship Which sucks too cuz he's just a rook, and has had an unreal season this yearThe clock ran out while he was still pretty far out.  Tackle from behind would've ended the gameOkay I‚Äôm gonna go on a rant here but I‚Äôm drunk and it‚Äôll probably go in a lot of directions.   This is the problem with the nfl, these guys try to make big hits instead of a fundamental tackle, it‚Äôs why guys get hurt, they throw themselves like missiles head first at guys where if he went in and wrapped up it would‚Äôve been a far better play.  I hate the Seahawks, but when they were great three years ago or whatever this is what they did.  They played ridiculous defence too but it was hit hard AND wrap up.  Don‚Äôt just try and hit the guy as hard as you can.    Use your arms to tackle, would result in way less head injuries too.  But I guess big hits pay the bills so I‚Äôm probably wrong.Even with no time on the clock.  The game can't end on a defensive penalty.Don't whiff the tackle or it'll look bad.I wish I had gold to give you for thisMe-owhttps://imgur.com/a/H8imiLitterally anything including diving the other way to not take out his teammate would of been betterThis is the New World Organization of Football brother[Marcus "Seth Rollins" Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWLU0MWMR-w)His future kids will remember it too What a great football sunday both these games were litHe missed that tackle so hard he knocked the whole vikings to next Sunday.Yeah this is really smartI felt a little better when he pulled that stunt for just that reason.  Now I feel like this might be our 2004 ALCS Red Sox over the Yankees moment. Decades of craziness can only be exorcised by opposite craziness.I told my friend I was having visions of Blair Walsh, 5 seconds later they started rolling those kicks on tv. I couldn't even drink my beer, I was too anxious, I just wanted Joe Buck to shut up and accept our fate... and the next thing I knew, I was hugging and yelling with the only other Vikings fan in the place (eastern Wisconsin bdubs).   I need a new hobby. I love this team too much, but it's killing me.Looked like he was scared of getting a penalty so he tried to slow down and avoid that, but then ended up wiffing entirelyDIGGS IN AN OPEN FIELD NEDThat's what I thought too, thank Diggs his football instincts are better than ours.I couldn't comprehend why he kept running until he hit the end zone. I was screaming the whole time and I'm not even a Vikings fan. You guys have my support until the end. If I was holding a controller I'd have thrown it after reading this. I hate auto switching players as I'm going for a sack and my defender just plopping down to the ground.Anybody but the Pats.obviously i'm going to root for the vikings, but if they fall...anyone but the patriots since the other 3 teams haven't won it!It's a testament to how good romo is that all of us who hate the cowboys love listening to his commentary.  lmao you got jokes cowboySigh. Upvote.Well maybe if you guys had a quarterback like Keenum instead of Peyton Manning then John Fox would've gone for itMVPVikings fans owe that a guy a lifetime of free beerWhat happened to the defender ..... he was looking for change .... I don't see any other option at this point.I never lost a playoff gamePlease go easy on Duluth He deserves it. What a fucking miraculous win after an unbelievable seasonI like Keenum. He beats Saints and doesn't afraid of anythingIt is known.Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, dude didn‚Äôt have to get to him ASAP, even if he couldn‚Äôt catch up til the 1 it would‚Äôve been game winning for SaintsNo one could do worse, not even a Chad.Seeing as I saved so much on car insurance, here's goldBow chicka wow wow[I expected this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/7/7b/Ripped_Pants_Gallery_%2814%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120708203919)He literally could have done nothing at all and have done a better job.His kid getting taunted on the playground,  goes to throw a punch, misses the other kid completely, and falls to the ground crying. Way better than the Patriots/Titans game. That game was boring.One of the best Sundays And knocked the Saints into next August...Until /r/hockey takes over Super Bowl GDT duties. Actually. No. That's still the best idea. Sad part is, a DPI would've been better in that scenario.Gods I whiffed then Ned.GODS I WAS A SUPER BOWL CONTENDER THENGRAB ME THE LEAD STRETCHER MARSHON LATTIMORE   GODS WHAT A STUPID NAMEJesus fuck this drives me up the wall and is my biggest pet peeve with MaddenI'm going to have a bunch more next week son I'm still waiting for a really late flag.Seriously tho. Your first quarterback and the stud you brought in to replace him get hurt. So, effectively, your 3rd string qb comes in and doesn't just manage games, he does shit like this. Sure, the defense is a monstrosity, yes their coach is a genius, but no other person could have done what Case Keenum did this year in the situation he found himself in. Unlike that scrub, Tom Brady.[deleted]I think I love you#NI HAOOk this one is just meanMissed the kid he was trying to punch and punches his sister in the eye instead*I love their Superbowl thread.Literally anything else would have been better. FETCH ME THE LEAD STRETCHERFETCH ME THE SEASON STRETCHER The last time the Cowboys made the NFC championship game Nick Foles was 5 years old.Look close and you'll see a flag thrown in the end zone after the score, probably for removing or throwing the helmet. Anyone can do it with 2400 reps in the VR machine /sRIP Maple Grove?I see you have already pillaged Superior.  Oh it's always like that? NVM.These guys fell in love and got married before they kicked the extra point.YOUR COACH WAS A DUMB WHORE WITH A FAT ARSE YOU KNOW THAT?UnsubscribeBingoNah man fuck Edina! Start with them!Blake Bortles has as many wins in the playoffs this year as Tony Romo does all time.UNSUBSCRIBEAlmost there....KEEP IT GOING

IM FUCKING MY GIRLFRIEND IN THE ASS TONIGHTThe annuel fuck you game continuesDeath, taxes and the Patriots losing in MiamiWow that's gotta be like the most embarrassing way to lose a football game in the last 10 years.The Patriots and pissing away the 1 seed in Miami. Name a more iconic duo.Having Gronk back there was an obvious mistake. Tannehill's not going to throw it 70 yards into the endzone (requiring a big body to knock the ball down) and Gronk's not a tackler. "This was the turning point on the Dolphins Superbowl LIII Championship Season..." PLAY OF THE WEEK! THATS MY TEAM!!!! I am physically ill.AHHHHHHHholy fuckI do not like that.That is a candidate for best last play of any game ever.  Just gotta admire it.   Witnessed history.  The Miami Miracle?I‚Äôve already rubbed one out to this three times and it happened 30 minutes ago Today, we are all Dolphins!Holy fuck what a game LOVE THE DRAKEI've carefully analyzed and researched every Patriots fan in view at the end and I've come to the conclusion that they didn't enjoy this.ESPN Gamecast win probability for Pats went from 99.9% to 0% pretty quick!Gronk why are you so damn slow Our defense is fucking trash.Ah, our annual "let's go into Miami and lose an important game" game. Love it.IF YOU DON‚ÄôT LIKE THAT, YOU DON‚ÄôT LIKE NFL FOOTBALLI love all the 12 jerseys in the crowd, just standing there stunned lmaoTHE BAND IS ON THE FIELD!It's a shame this wasn't a playoff game.Dolphins won because they wore those sexy ass jerseys. Top 3 jersey of any kind in the NFL ever. My God they're perfectMajor, major props to #62 on the Dolphins. O lineman hustling 50 yards down the field to make the key block. Dude deserves to be recognized.Derrick Henry's 99 yard run is the play everyone will be talking about this week!  Miami Dolphins : *"Lateral my beer."*Brady just can‚Äôt win in MIA lol A hook and ladder play to beat a dynastic rival by exactly one point on the last play of the game? That is prime daydream material. Insane play!Let's just go ahead and pin this one modsSometimes I ask myself why I‚Äôm a fan of Miami because we‚Äôre always so mediocre, and then the annual pats game in miami rolls around and keeps me going through next yearSeeing all the Miami love warms my heart‚ù§  Better enjoy it while it lasts haha We seriously just witnessed an all-time NFL highlight. Wow.NICE. When patriots lose, America wins. I'm sure there have been some great scoring plays this year, but this has to be in the Top 1. I could watch Drake beat Gronk to the outside as he stumbles on a loop forever. Dolphins are my new favorite animal.Holy shit this might as well be porn. Holy fuck. Only other lateral play that worked was the saints one but they missed the xp and lost anyways. I want to hear the Patriots radio broadcast of the play.  So maybe Gronk isn't the best safety on the planet. Oops.Who‚Äôs 87 and why‚Äôs he playing safety...and why‚Äôd he stumble? and that‚Äôs GRONK! WTF In case you were wondering, this is kinda like how it felt to lose the super bowl. https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.pngDRAKE, SIDELINE, TOUCHDOWN, DOLPHINS WIN IT!!!Just like we drew it up#I WANNA LIVE!Miami Miracle!We technically needed the Pats to win but I'll never be sad to watch them lose. *puts entire video into spoon*  *boils with a lighter*  *injects deep into vein in neck*  ü§§NO ONE TALK TO ME FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKWhat an amazing game! Couldn‚Äôt believe this! I was screaming at the top of my lungs.   Absolutely a miracle finish! So proud of this team today! Fought all game! GG Patriots!  ‚ÄúThe Miami Miracle‚Äù!Watched it live at the Patriots bar i work at in San Diego. The whole bar went insane and one of the servers started laughing and saying "that was so awesome holy shit" to which the Patriots fans replied "you're not getting any tips today." Every Time the pats take an L is a good day of football In the immortal words of the great Jim Mandich...  Awwwright Miami!Thanks Dolphins! You da best!Just leaving my mark on this historic moment don‚Äôt mind meThe bar I was in erupted when this happened and I don‚Äôt think there were any dolphins or patriots fans there.Its nice to see New England get an fat L at the expense of the trickery miami dolphins BEST. DAY. EVER.Oh man, even the ticker read 33-28 at the end of the 4th.   https://gyazo.com/adad421162d588078c18310c2f2dc543Awesome! Get fucked New England!NFL gonna change the rule on lateral backward passing after the rule worked against the Patriots.Gronk ALLOWED the 69-yard touchdown. any other coach, and the media is making him a pariah.   &#x200B;  Gronk looked ridiculous out there.The Phinish."This will end it."[deleted]Miami will always haunt New England.  Couldn't have a perfect season and playoff just like Miami and can't even beat Miami at home.  The Miami Curse is in full effect. i‚Äôve never seen this play work in any game i‚Äôve ever watched but i‚Äôm glad it happened to the patriots Funny how this is the second most upvoted thing but Patriots are still wining the superbowl. Oh the ironyno fucking wayWhat a save! What a save! What a save!Best thing I‚Äôve seen this year.   I love Gronk but damn he was not expecting that at all. AT ALL.Gronkowski looked like FrankensteinYour Gronk is malfunctioningOk this kinda makes me feel better about our loss to Miami weeks ago.Bill Simmons on suicide watchPats deserved to lose. Missed extra point. Missed field goal. Brady took a sack at the end of the first half that should've been a free 3 points had he thrown it away. That's 7 easy points they threw away.  Tough play to watch, but credit to Miami. They always play us tough at home. And wow our defense gave up like 6 plays of over 30 yards today.  And the defense spoiled Brady's best start since the Superbowl. Tough to watch.CRAZY OVERREACTION -  If MIA wins out, then the Patriots need to win 2/3 or else they miss the playoffs. Yeah Patriots have bad teams in BUF and NYJ at home but divisional games can get real freaking weird and their other game is PIT on the road.62 laid a *murder block* on 23 holy fuckPatriots always go overboard with hookers and blow in Miami.  And it costs them dearly.As a patriots fan, I am heart broken and angry. But, as a pure fan of the sport of football, I am in pure awe. That kind of, last second ditch effort, balls to the walls, play never really works out successfully. Truly a joy to watch as a fan of the sport.MIAMI HAS THE DOLPHINSPatriots and losing in Miami in December, name a better duo.  Go ahead, I'll wait..I WAS HEREYou gotta be kidding me, first time I witness this happeningThe dolphins are now 7-6 with a -55 scoring differential.  [me repeatedly watching this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--H8nn6YFS--/erxcdjlfkleigcdylrvo.gif)Why the fuck was gronk playing safety? He can barely run Pats @ MiamiSomeone finally pulled off that play....(Throws controller at ground)  -my little brotherLol literally did this last night on franchise mode nfc championship gameLook at mr. fancy on his ps4 while I‚Äôm still on ps2.Down 5 with :07 left and 2/3 of the field to go. Those fools[deleted]Tom Brady getting SQUISHED by the FISH is becoming somewhat of a tradition. Only in miami tho lolOur HC would have punted the ball in this situation, I'm glad yours didn'tCall the dipsy doodle. It's never worked, but fuck it, it's got to eventually, right? Maybe now...Why do you underestimate them. The dolphins at home in Miami is Brady‚Äôs Achilles heelMaybe next time you‚Äôll estimate them!Patriots are now 1-6 in Miami in recent history we have their number.Tom Brady: ‚ÄúI have been publicly humiliated for the LAST TIME!‚ÄùIt's really bizarre Will Miami survive the mass party going to happen tonight?It's like his mind knew he should run, but his body decided to just fall overhttps://i.imgur.com/quRPfDj.jpgMods please mark NSFWHail Mary laterals üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇHOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTAKE THAT PATS, YOU BITCH  YOUVE REIGNED FOR FAR TOO LONG. MARK MY WORDS, THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END  ^^^probably ^^^not ^^^but ^^^a ^^^man ^^^can ^^^dreamPats @ Miami happened.Dolphins score on final play to beat the pats. Come on dude, it says in the title.  /sIf it were a Rodgers-esque hail mary, then he'd be the perfect guy to have back there on D.  But against the lateral party...It was crazy to put him deep anyway At least put Gordon back there if anything.[https://i.imgur.com/quRPfDj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/quRPfDj.jpg)I mean, you can blame gronk but if the game saving tackle has to come down to him, it means 4-5 people in front of him missed a tackle or took a bad angle. a 70 yard cushion for help defenders to swarm to the ball and they couldnt. How pathetic of a defensive effortWe r/nba now! 2-0 in throwbacks this year!No kidding! That was some seriously 90's-esque dolphins; both uniform and excitement.These are the best uniforms in all of sports Gronk let it happen on purpose. Nice.nice. conspiracy: Gronk let him score for this reason.Gronkowski betrayed by his own favorite number.NICE!Patriots D: "This shit almost never works"  Also Patriots D: "Oh shit!"Literally looks like every defender was expecting someone else to make the tackle. lmfaoHe's probably a frequent poster in our sub. Its rough in there sometimesThat's fucking amazingHe sounds like most Dolphins fans I've met.   I refused to give up until the last whistle blew. Still unbelievable.THE GREATEST FOOTBALL TEAM THE GREATEST FOOTBALL TEAMAgreed 100%. Was it Derrick Henry's 99 yard run from Thursday until this happened? So short lived... whatever, my man will still be remembered for that. When was the last time an NFL team actually scored on a multiple-lateral play to win the game?Play of the century.South Beach ShockerMiracle in Miami has better flow imhoGronkowski...  **DIDN'T HAVE THE ANGLE!!!** (gronk immediately trips over his own feet)  LMAO!!! Great play, great callI can't stop     I **won't** stop17 years. We still have 2008 friend Does the Music City Miracle not count because a kickoff return isn't considered a "play?"Is this true? \> First last second  \> 1st. Last. 2nd.Brady's kryptonite He‚Äôs 1-4 at Miami against Tannehill  Did you know that? I bet you didn‚Äôt. No one did. Now they all do   What the fuck is this world coming to  A loss in MIA? No big deal! I took the points today anyway!  A loss like THAT!?? No one deserves to lose like that Fucking wild. I'll take one for the playoffs.Absolutely fucking mental breakdown.Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. May tannehill eternally haunt your dreams.Does she know yet?Username checks outYou were going to do that anyway don't gloatThis comment killed meSubscribeBrady and losing in 80 degree or higher temperatures.Cant piss away the 1st seed if you arent first seed.    Pat's likely still 2nd seed after today....mehNo, Gronk knew it was a 69 yard play.   Hard decision, but he was chuckle-burping as he tumbled-farted to the turf. Yes there's that trademark 'dumb, cute shit' biting us in the ass againYup...also don't know why the fuck Harmon didn't just wrap up.  You can't finish every game with a pick Duron. MIAMI HAS THE DOLPHINS, THE GREATEST FOOTBALL TEAM!Talk to me dirty....Easily. Play of the season candidate.Play of the year so far imoI'm just slamming my dick in the door over and over....HHHHHHHHHHI do like thatI like that you don‚Äôt like thatGetting real physical playing football.  I like that.What. The. Fuck.[I'm personally a big fan of this one.](https://youtu.be/OJzpoj_NxqQ)  But this was incredible. Doubly so because all week Miami/Pats fans kept saying how Miami just seems to have the Pats number @Miami.Do you have a dorsal fin? To train ze dolphin you must zink like ze dolphin! You must be getting inside ze dolphin's head. I am saying to Snowflake, "Akay!... Akay Akay Akay?" und he is saying "AKay Akay!" und he is up on ze tail "Eeeeeeeeee!" und you can quote him!GOT TO LOOOOO-OVE THE DRAKEI hate the Drake! [Interesting data visualization of the Patriots win probability over the last few seconds of the game.](https://media.giphy.com/media/KOEc8ca7DELmw/giphy.gif)Playing defense against NFL talent is actually hard. It's not his job to anticipate cuts or chase people down.Yeah Gronkowski is a horrible safety, seems like he's being played out of position That was pathetic defense and putting Gronk back there was a bad idea from the get-go.Yeah gronk really sucks in the secondary I dont like NFL football.Ted Larsen. When asked what he was thinking at the time, he replied, ‚ÄúI was kind of hoping they wouldn‚Äôt pitch me the ball.‚Äùand it happened against the pats lmaoIronic, isn't it?There has not been a successful game-ending lateral play since then, until today.are you legitimately being upvoted for saying there have only been two successful last-second lateral plays in the history of the NFL lmaoFirst one to win a game then damn that make it even more thrilling Color commentator as he sees only Gronk between Drake and the end zone: "Oh, Jesus."Tide pods[deleted]Howdy üê¨Oh fuck off.  You're playoff bound for like the 20th time this decade.I respect the hell out of this take.He let it go because it was a 69 yard touchdown  edit: PFT and I made this joke independently, it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots when you see Gronk and you see a 69 yard touchdown. That being said, I fucking love PMT and PFT is 100000x funnier than I will ever be and I would never try to steal his jokes.[removed]FIRE BELICHICKCoverage, apparentlyHe was in there for the jump ball, not to tackleCause he's tall as shit and has great hands. They put him back there every time they're expecting a hail mary. If it couldn't be Brady falling on his face as they lost that game, I'm glad it was Gronk.https://i.imgur.com/quRPfDj.jpgTo catch in case they throw a hail mary.(Screams at me saying "Look what you made me do!")(Throws controller at wall)  - Me, a 27 year old man(throws controller at little brother)If the CPU hit me with that shit it's an automatic 'close application' and switching games.Hey I'm on the NFC championship game in Franchise Mode üëÄ69 yards, to get Gronk on DThey forgot it was in Miami and not Foxboro.They left too much time for Drake!(Kenyon) Drake scoring as God intended  ...   ...   God's PlanI figured the whole ‚ÄúBrady‚Äôs Kryptonite‚Äù thing was so hyped up this year that there was no way it would happen again. I was so wrong.New York Giants in the Superbowl would like to have a word with you.Right up there with playing the Giants in the super bowl. Dolphins at home, Bronocs at home.  Games I just expect to lose at this pointMichael.....*Snicker in Dolphin*The Dolphins keep us grounded.  No matter how good it's been under Belichick/Brady, we can always count on feeling like shit at least once a season @MIA.I flew 3,000 miles to watch this game. It was exciting, but DAMN. The theory is that Pats usually start growing their winter fur this time of year. So when they have to come to Miami late, their body temperature is actually twice that what it would be in a cold weather location. This leads to exhaustion and disorientation as seen on this play.Well they‚Äôve made it mostly intact through Art Basel, so probably.Gronk was trying to make that camera guy from the 1st half feel better by showing him even professional athletes can fall over while running. Good Guy Gronk!I agree because this is the absolute best porn out there.  Belicheck/Brady is now 7-10 in Miami.  Not 7 of 10, 7 wins & 10 losses.Who play called this üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  -HoHHail Mary full of grace, the Lateral is with me.The South Beach miracle.[deleted]Line him up 40 yards back then lol. He would have had an angle on Drake that way in this play too.It's not even a Hail Mary situation what the shit.Couple of bad calls by the patriots at the end  Shouldn‚Äôt have kicked the field goal... go for it on fourth down.  Get a TD and game over.  Don‚Äôt and so what, dolphins down 2 with :16 left at their own 2.   Bad coaching   EDIT- for reference, see my last comment.Aside from that fact that half the fucking defense was just standing there, I did a double take when I saw Gronk there in safety. I mean, wtf? Whatever. That last play was far from the problems the Patriots have, clearly shown by this game.  Amazing playOr put out a normal defense. Endless laterals and running around in circles shouldn't work against 11 NFL defenders. They tried that earlier this season already and almost lost to a Hail Mary that was a yard short. Y‚Äôall look so different! 0-6 Miami Vice jerseys died for this.Unis were more 70s/80s.  90s dolphins had the drop shadow numerals, along with the 49ers. He knows the right angle to take for the 69Rob Gronkowski did not know his powers could be used against himNicegronk starts tannehillDolphins O: "Almost"https://i.imgur.com/tpFiOuJ.jpg//# 27 was jogging until Drake cut up the field and only gronk was in front of him.It's one thing to play contain to let the other guy make the tackle. But there aren't many "other guys" when you rush 4 and the safety is Gronk, who isn't experienced with the responsibilities of the safety (i.e. the safety might have been responsible for sealing off the sideline, because there were defenders in the middle of the field). The DB that defended the pass strangely tried to play the ball or something (and whiffed the receiver) instead of simply wrapping the legs after the catch.I'd laugh my ass off if it turned out he was a redditor and posted there in game day threads. I would like to see his comments. He's a radiologist doctor and he still acts like a fucking emo teenager when it comes to football.Probably JCVent or whatever his name isTHEY'LL TAKE THE BALL FROM GOAL TO GOALOnly undefeated team in NFL history.God bless Henry but there was much more on the line here. God damn, Miami!And both Drake and Henry played on Alabama's 2016 championship teamPlay of the existence of the universeYou usually gotta pay extra for that. üòè> 69 yards  > Gronk missed tackle  Yep I support this. South Beach Shocker it isYea but that was mainly us vs. the jets. The pats didn‚Äôt have bradyDoesn't count cause it wasn't last secondThe Saints scored on a play like this once years ago, but missed the extra point and lost. So yup, first ‚Äúfuck it let‚Äôs just pitch it a few times and see what happens‚Äù to win a gameEli goes to Miami in 2019Denver tooIt really is, he only has 60 regular season losses for his entire career.. 1/6 of them @MIA That will be 28.33That's why you don't put a fucking tight end on defenseJudging by that username, I'm gonna say she does.Does she ever?https://media.giphy.com/media/9t6xpYZ9npJmM/giphy.gifI know the Pats lost this one but Brady played much better today than he has historically in Miami.  Also, amazing fucking game plan by the Dolphins. Tannehill exploited all the holes in the Pats defense and the running game was great.Watch the Chargers somehow end up with the 1 seed.Except Pat's winning a chiefs coughing on up against Baltimore would have had them 1st>chuckle-burping as he tumbled-farted to the turf.   Shakespearean in your delivery. This is the funniest thing I've read in weeks> he was chuckle-burping as he tumbled-farted to the turf.  classic gronkPure poetry. This really tickled me üòÇ"Nice." *brrrrrrrt*WE'RE IN THE AIR WE'RE ON THE GROUNDWE LATERAL THE BALL ON THE LAST PLAY LIKE NO ONE‚ÄôS EVER SEEN!What‚Äôs its competition? A bunch of long runs that have been cool, but nothing like this, there have been a bunch of cool picks, but again nothing remotely like this. IMO it‚Äôs already play of the seasonPlay of the decade candidateSAME BUT IM CUMMING WHILE DOING ITSame I in fact love that.But do you Vike that?Thats fucking football right there. None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit. Men puke, men poop on the field, men deliver their new born baby on the side lines. Fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball foosball fuck it chuck it game time shit.I could feel the jinx all week. Huge play. why would gronk be the safety??!Time to get Jon Bois on the case again!!And I bet there won‚Äôt be another one until it works again.Well the saints one was, and still is the only three lateral touchdown ever.Okay, this is it. I've had enough speculation and I'll accept no other explanation than this.NiceJust like they drew it up.I don‚Äôt know how they expected Tanehill to throw it 70 yards through the airHail Mary prevention on a fairly obvious non-Hail Mary play. Whoops.Worth noting that we were 70 yards away, I don't think Tanny can throw that far.He can still barely run, which was pretty evident when he couldn't catch Drake.Look likes Bill overthought it. But they weren‚Äôt even close enough for a Hail Mary!  Just keep the DBs in there. SubscribeDid anyone tell him he was supposed to defend?"I can't believe you've done this"Alright there, Taylor.My brother in law and I declare "madden has decided" when kooky stuff happens.  Like when at the end of a half the CPU comes out and plays unstoppably for a tying or winning drive.  Or a receiver that is clearly down from the replay has a fumble stand. FFS.I did that, then smoked a bowl to chill out lola couple of months ago i was playing the SB as the Pats vs. the Cowboys, and was up by 6 with :05 left. They threw a bomb to the endzone that wasn't even close to being caught, but of course, PI. Ball on the 1 and they ran it in with Zeke. Haven't played since lmao69 on D. Nice. When it comes to 69, Gronk assumed he just had to do his part, and someone else would take care of the D for him. I'm convinced that Belichick made a deal with the devil and the Miami away game was his sacrifice. I know it happens but it's always a shock to me.You live 3,000 miles from the nearest TV?Crazy that any team would be expected to be 7 of 10 at another teams stadium... but Brady is almost 9/10 at New Era FieldüòÇüòÇ tfw lateral Top comment is some dumb shit like "Dwight would have been on that ass if he was playing safety"WHO REMEMBERS WHEN DWYANE WADE WAS THE HoH PROFILE PICüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇMiami Miracle flows betterI might die(t)He had the angle here too, he just didn't take it at first and then stumbledFor real though what was Belichick thinking. I was hoping they'd go for it as well. Unless BB was worried they'd get a long pass that out them in FG range. I can‚Äôt believe my friends think I‚Äôm crazy for saying this exact thing. It made no sense to go up by 5. Either go up 37-28 and the win is cemented, or don‚Äôt score, you‚Äôre up 30-28 with the opponent on their own 2-yard line with :16 and no timeouts.  Belichick has seriously lost his mindYes you always get punished playing it safe. karmaThat fucking Miami boomed meWE HAVE AN [expletive] SUBREDDIT NOW. That‚Äôs a dead meme, find a new slantWe're so goodThey were actually the 1966-1973 uniforms -- you know, the ones they wore when during their undefeated '72 season. Why would they wear anything else as a throwback?  Nice I love that both D: and O: describe Pats and Fins fans' faces, respectivelyBB after putting a tight end on defense lolI need this with a Patriots hat on.And you know Belichick is going to dress Gronk down for this too. Like, how dare he not be able to read the play correctly and presage the right angles.Based off that description I'd say there's a very good chance he frequents our sub. Atleast the game threads, those are hell holes.I hate that fuckLIKE NO ONE'S EVER SEENHenry‚Äôs was more straight up impressive, this was the greatest play though in my opinion. 2015I'm not sure how you forgot the 2008 game where we unveiled the wildcat against the patriots in fox-borough and trounced them.  As a 30 year old dolphins fan that is easily my favorite dolphins game ever.Even then, that kick was to tieNOOOOOOOOOOOOO2-14, but those 2 wins are against the Pats. For real, Tanehill isn‚Äôt going to throw a 70 hard Hail Mary lolYup and why they should have just gone for the TD on the other end, they weren't going to get into FG range starting inside their own 5 in 15 seconds.You would think with a user name like that she would stop making that bet. Aw you‚Äôre a good sport Homefield 'advantage'.Yea but the chiefs won so they wouldn‚Äôt be 1st seed anyways. The way they‚Äôre playing this year they don‚Äôt deserve it anyhow. They are clearly not the best team if the AFC. Media never gives any love to Miami, so I wouldn't doubt it being glossed over. Granted we've done little to earn media praise since 2008, but we've had some great plays this year and we won't get a single play shown on a weekly recap on some of these shows. If we ignore importance of the game a play takes place in, this wins easily.Fuck you I laughed at this shitHoly shit I love this subnearly bought gold to give to you.Same I doThis is my favorite pastaTo bat down a hail mary attemptMusic City Miracle was a thingThe Pats were the only ones in the world who thought Tannehill could throw it 70 yards. They lined Gronk up in safety to bat down a hail mary. A miracle can only happen when people make mistakes. Coaching mistakes like this, missed tackles, hell even Amendola and Parker are standing around like 'what do I do now?'NiceAnd he didntWith a bad shoulder Belicheck with some mad respect for Ryan 'Rocket Arm' Tannehill.Who the hell would think Tannehill is throwing that 70 yards?Prior to the shoulder injury maybe. Definitely not right now. Clearly the pats coaches felt differently.He also stumbled, wasn't prettyDon't really need to on a Hail Mary"Gronk, if the ball goes near you catch it"  "Gronk have to do anything else?"  "Nah"Defend the pass, not defend the run. He was never told to do that. Maybe.You can only command him in 1 word phrases. They had to choose between 'tackle' and 'cover'. Yup. Madden is its own universe with its own logic and a cruel sense of irony I just imagine the dolphin crossing the goalline for the 69 yd TD and gronk just stands up straight, smiles and goes "Nice." Then he jogs gingerly off the field, not even acknowledging he just gave up the game winning touchdown. Pretty good deal for him all things considered lol.SameI live 3,000 miles from the warmest stadium the Patriots are playing at He was thinking in 2000D ultra high def 28-3 intergalactic chest while the Dolphins were thinking of that dilly dally high school shit.Sending Walcott on that earlyCan't wait for a reporter to ask some question like that and get met with "We play Pittsburgh on Sunday"From their own 2 with :16 seconds and no timeouts, getting out of bounds in FG range seems way more unlikely than the possibility of a KR TD, Hail Mary, or that bullshit I just witnessed.Oh come on. You would never expect a team to drive 75 yards for a TD with :16. More likely for them to get about 55 to get a field goal, cause they can heave it and either get a catch or a PI callThey‚Äôre so creative x4 x4 Nice(: this Jets fan face. https://i.imgur.com/CRZ71xv.jpg  shittily done, as it should beWE'RE IN THE AIR WE'RE ON THE GROUNDThe Night Courage Wore Orange was pretty special in my heart  https://youtu.be/riFY4A6wXIUMine too, but it wasn‚Äôt against Brady. That‚Äôs what I was getting at I have no problem with thatI mean you get a great draft pick and still beat the Pats. Tannehill probably could if he had to. His shoulder still has pain and isn‚Äôt 100%Just like they weren't going to score a td from their own 30 with seven seconds left.Narrator: but she secretly loved it. Thanks! The stats don‚Äôt lie and I can‚Äôt really be too mad at the Dolphins when they win on a play like that. Gotta take it on the chin!Honestly, you might need sarcasm quotes around both words there.Chargers have a 9-3 record on the road this season.  Pretty remarkable, if you ask me.The importance of this game for Miami cannot be understated. We win this game with a pretty favorable schedule going forward. No guarantee we make the playoffs, but boy are we in a better position. How do you "nearly" buy gold? STFU broke ass bitch, I got him coveredBuy silver then SameSkol!There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre doing a 70 yard Hail Mary though Hahaha!! This is spot onI wonder how many QBs could air it out 70+their defenders said in post game interviews that they werent expecting him to throw it 70+ yards, they werent playing for a hail mary.  It seems to just be a coaching snafu having him in there instead of someone who can actually tackle and cut off an angleTannehill playing 7D backgammon.Exactly and a bad ankle potentially.Bill Belichick, apparently.[Alternate angle](https://mobile.twitter.com/RoFlo/status/1071875905482452993?s=09)But you do if they try a hook and ladder type play instead, since ya know, they're 70 yards away. Should have had Patterson or Gordon out thereShoulda told him to spike the ball, he'd have forced a fumble to get it.Gronk confused It does look from that angle like he realized he needed to try and tackle about one or two steps too late, though. Lol  Like if he had been angling for it from the beginning he would have been good."We've got other guys for that"  Narrator: they did, but they all fell overThat's why I play on Rookie.  Yeah, I suck.  Ain't trying to make video games my work[deleted]ABOYNE (vb.)   To beat an expert at a game of skill by playing so appallingly that none of his clever tactics or strategies are of any use to him.  &#x200B;  \- Douglas Adams, The Deeper Meaning of Liff The KR was what I was most concerned about. Little did I know that Gronk's d ability would be the real nail in the coffin. [deleted]NephewNice.You're a god damn hero and I love you.WE'RE ALWAYS IN CONTROL!4-12. Gotta beat the Jets too.Neither do i. I don't think he could chuck it 70+ in the air.>	Gotta take it on the chin!  That means two thingsBLESS NiceSameWait a second... that's Uncle Rico's music!!Rodgers threw a 75 yard throw in high school. I honestly wonder how far he can throw it now because he hit 70 on one throw that drew a PI vs the Lions and didn‚Äôt even put much into it.  I‚Äôd assume Mahomes, Cam Newton, and probably Josh Allen could. Cutler for sure back when he played. He hit a 65 yard throw in 2016 still"Belichick outsmarted himself", one of the reporters just strikingly spoke during SNF.And it went for a 7D yard touchdown! (I tried)So *this* is why he benched Butler in the Superbowl.Certified idiot coachhttps://i.imgur.com/quRPfDj.jpgOr maybe just their normal prevent defense...Or a defender :p  It‚Äôs unlikely Gordon is a great tackler either. Still this is one of those 1/100 plays that happens once or twice a year, a shame we are on the end of it. To be fair, he wasn't the only Pays defender that thought someone else would make the tackle.That's how I almost drew against the only ranked Chess player I ever played.  I just kept playing carnage chess until neither one of us had many pieces left.  He looked like Paul Blart Mall Cop trying to stop a shoplifter ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We got an [expletive] karma train nowNiceAND WHEN YOU SAY MIAMII bet he could throw it over them mountains.'EMSameTannehill can throw a pretty comfortable and accurate 60 yard bomb, I'd be confident that when healthy he could hit 65.  Not sure about 70+ thoughJosh Allen definitely can. https://youtu.be/YAc-yNX8MYk  Also don't forget about Stafford. Dude has a rocket for an arm. Very informative reply thanks!I mean its not wrong.  Gronk looked terrible trying to run down that guy.  I like going for it on 4th and goal the previous play to basically ice the game if you make it, and worst case scenario (aside a pick 6) is the dolphins have the ball on their 4 yard line with 15ish seconds and no timeouts down 2.  I like that better than giving them a kickoff and at least one play from their 25ish yard line to do something with while down 5.   Username checks out That was magnificent.There‚Äôs a reason he only lasted one day with the jets I would rather have an extra second string DB than an offensive player playing defense in that situation. Call me crazy.Yeah, if I were any good at end game chess I'd try this strategy too. Instead I try to play positionally and still fuck up and still lose. YOU'RE TALKING SUPER BOWLhttps://i.imgur.com/bA9xFsq.gifvThe legendary Miami mountain range Sameredditgod1-7 are not amusedHe probably has some dirt on Kraft.  Only explanation that makes sense for how he has lasted so long. Usually I just strut around knocking pieces over and take a shit on the board.

r/nfl,34-28 Final Kraft throwing deflategate shade during that speech. Fuckin classicAnd decades from now we will still hear tale of when Lady Gaga rallied the Patriots from a 21-3 halftime deficit to win Super Bowl 51. The boos lmaoHoly fuck thank god I'm actually a Bears fanTeams who get a pick-6 in the Superbowl are now only 12-1.  Teams who have a 11+ point lead in the Superbowl are no longer undefeated.  Teams that held a 19+ point lead at the half in the postseason are now 93-1.  Let all those sink in.   Edit: Turns out I'm wrong. Do research before you speak, kids.And once again, the North has burned Atlanta to the ground.What the fuck just happenedIf im in a championship game/series i might let the other team take a big lead because clearly those teams have been cursed To the guy who said this Superbowl needed to compete with other finals, it did. Warriors blew a 3-1 lead. Indians blew a 3-1 lead. Falcons blew a 25 point lead as is tradition.These were not the Tom Brady Superbowl tears I requestedEveryone booing Goodell was amazinghttps://imgur.com/gallery/VNaUcMichael Floyd drunk drove him self to a championship ring.Falcons had a chance to put this game away.  4 minutes left, had the ball in field goal range. Tried to throw the ball, took a sack. Tried to throw again, holding call. Got pushed out of field goal range. If they just run it twice it's an 11 point game with 3:30 left and new england would have been out of timeouts.   How do you fuck that up???This is the most Atlanta thing in Atlanta history Lady Gaga had more yards in the air than the Falcons did the second half. You're on the 22 with 4 minutes left and up 8. Just run the damn ball 3 times and kick a field goal. Huge choke job.   Edit: Thanks for the gold!That transition from being one of the most boring Super Bowl's of all-time to the most exciting happened so fast I'm still struggling to catch my breath. #The Atlanta Falcons Have Been Eliminated From Championship ContentionThat's right, the entire crowd savages Goodell during his entire presentation.  Fuck you Gooey.Shout out to the refs. I honestly can't think of one botched call that determined the games outcome. Outside of some jersey holds  that were extremely difficult to spot, really solid call, let the men play ball.  That ref that called Eldlemans catch deserves a raise.jfc, we are a meme nowim kissing that motherfucker  im kissing this fucking bitch  hey hey kiss this fucking bitch  mute audio  **"Kiss this motherfucker, tongue it!"**I never watch football.  After this game, holy shit, I get it now.  I thought it was sealed until the 4th quarter, just wow.http://i.imgur.com/cjIx5aQ.pngHow does Julio Jones finish that game with only 4 targets?  It's simple, if he's open, throw it to him, if he's covered, throw it to him and let him show off his athleticism.  Edit: For those saying he was doubled all game...I know. He was doubled on all 4 targets also...4 catches 87 yards.  Edit #2: 4 targets is the fewest in a game for Julio since his rookie season in 2011. Kyle Shanahon with some of the worst play calling I've ever ever seen in a situation like this.

Holy fuck. First the warriors now this.Bill is going to have everyone in early tomorrow to go over all the mistakes that occurred in the first 52 minutes of the game.[Everyone to Tom Brady](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/5d/65/415d6529bc3b3069a7e78f2875f455de.jpg)http://i.imgur.com/NQjgc89.gifAll the boos for Goodell, I fucking love it.If you missed this game and only looked at the score and go: "I can probably imagine what happened."  It's not what you imagined.The crowd booing when Goodell held that trophy was one of the greatest moments in football television.  Can't script it any better That comeback was fucking ridiculous.  They not only needed two touchdowns, they needed TWO goddamned two-point conversions to tie the game.  They got both of them. BOTH. That just does not happen.   http://i.imgur.com/wZEm5DR.jpg That booing was incredible!Wow. That was probably the biggest choke of all time in any sportTeacher: Pop quiz students! Does anyone know what to do when you're down by 25 points in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl?  Tom Brady: https://i.imgur.com/tHhnpqB.png Fuck you Atlanta, what a historic collapse. Listen  I know we just witnessed the greatest comeback in the history of the sport.  I know tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time, bill is the best coach, and these pats the best dynasty.   But goddamn it this is fuckig horseshit. Greatest Patriots of all time:  1) Tom Brady  2) George Washington  3) Abraham LincolnSB LI, 2016 World Series, 2016 NBA Finals, it's been a crazy year for sportsThat Edelman catch was fucking legendaryPAtriots won on a 31-0 run.  31-0  3-1  Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals[removed]Where were you when falcons were kill?  I was at home eating doritos when get call from belichek  "Falcons is kill"  "no"This is the darkest timeline.    EDIT: Why the hell did I get gold? F bomb dropped on global TV.As a die hard Patriots fan since 2 minutes ago this means so much to meEuropean here. This was literally my first time watching a whole game of football. I heard of Tom Brady, Patriots and Belichick but thats about it. So I was watching the game with a couple of buddies. One of them knows a lot more about the game and the teams, and prides himself on that fact. From the very beginning I was talking shit and saying Patriots would win it, pretending to know a lot more than I do. He was rooting for the Falcons. As the game is on the way and Falcons are dominating he was feeling quite secure in his superior knowledge of the game. Anyway, at 0 - 21, just before the half time, I predicted that Lady Gaga wouldn't lip sync and would be awesome, that Patriots would make an epic movie worthy comeback and win the game, and that Tom Brady would be the hero. His face as the game progressed was priceless and it made my first experience of football something special. I think he might have left actually believing I knew what I was talking about.  P.S. I also predicted that Tom Brady will be president one day. Make of that what you will.Unbelievable. I knocked out half way through and woke up with 6 minutes left and pats down 16. Well lemme turn back in case Brady just some crazy 4th quarter come back again   GOAT. That catch be Edelman vs 3 defenders was insane Who would've thought a run play on the goal line would work. Wow.  That was one of the biggest collapses I've seen in my life from the Falcons.  Congrats to the Pats, the Evil empire reigns supreme."Kiss this mother fucker"LOL Goodell being booed out the stadium. [removed]Best SB ever.   Brady is GOAT and there is no more debate. The golden state warriors are the true winners tonightlmao that piece of shit Goodell getting booed to oblivion.[deleted]First football game I ever watch. What the fucking fuck, this was perfect. I don't remember watching anything like what Brady did tonight.  Argentine Sixers fan here tho, time to follow the Eagles. All I know is Wentz but I think I have time to research before the season starts.    LMAO KRAFT TWISTING THE DAMN KNIFE IN GOODELL'S HEART!!In case y'all missed it:  The records that we're broken by the Patriots tonight:  1. First Super Bowl Game to go into OT.  2. Largest deficit to return and win the game in NFL history(previously 10, Patriots came back from 25 points).  3. Most Super Bowl wins by a Quarterback   4. Most Super Bowl wins by a head coach  5. Most Super Bowl MVP wins by a quarterback. God has officially abandoned us.[removed]HOLY FUCK KRAFT WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFELove how everyone is booing Roger. [deleted]There is no God[found tom brady's retirement home](http://i.imgur.com/mWWJkk5.jpg) I grew up watching the end of the montana era along with young, elway, farve, aikman and marino. Being a kid, watching those guys i saw them larger than life. The older i got analysts, relatives, parents of my friends time and time again (usially) went back to montana as #1 with most of the others in the top group. In my teens came peyton and  brady slowly climbing their  way up but by then that awe and magic of being a kid seeing the best pros had faded.  This was true of any sport, after all i grew up watching jordan and he's almsot unanimously considered the goat.      In my 20s  i carried that in my mind montana was the greatest & most others of that era were in that top group ( along with those of past eras who i didnt get to watch) . Sure i saw manning & brady with that group but there was always a slight separation of sorts &  always seemed to be a rational (ie the game had changed) that either couldn't reach #1 definitively.    I hadn't thought about it for yrs until i pressed myself to revisit it after the pateiots won the divisional round, went back and realized just how phenomenal and deserving of that #1 spot brady is.   Then there was today, cementing tom and dethroning my childhood hero.   "Yea kiss dis muhfucka nahumsayin?"# DON'T LET THIS DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT THE ATLANTA FALCONS BLEW A 28-3 LEAD IN SUPER BOWL LIFalcons blew a 28-3 lead. The Patriots scored 31 unanswered points. Warriors blew a 3-1 lead. Indians blew a 3-1 lead. This the dankest timeline. Tom Brady is the GOAT.Like him or not, we just witnessed the greatest quarterback of all time play the greatest Super Bowl of all time to make the greatest comeback of all time to break the record for most Super Bowls won. Mad respect   Edit: a couple of clarifications based on the comments:  - "play the greatest super bowl of all time" meaning the best individual performance of all time in a super bowl (up for debate obviously), not that this was the greatest SB of all time  - "greatest comeback of all time" in a SB  - technically tied the record for most SBs won by an individual with Charles Haley    Edit2: Hey my first gold! Woohoo! Thanks kind stranger! Love all the boos lolROBERT KRAFT GOING IN LIKE A STONE COLD KILLERHahaha all the booing while goodell presented the trophy was epic Not my championI feel like I just received the best blowjob of my life then right before I was about to nut, she punched me full on in the balls. Damn!!! Goodell getting booed harder than Roman Reigns!WHO GETS BOOED HARDER ROGER GOODELL OR ROMAN REIGNS?Not one thing political was mentioned that entire game and it was glorious. What a beautiful escape from reality. What a game. What a halftime show. At least Donald Glover won something for Atlanta.The greatest smartest move was to remove blount from the game !! I felt super happy after that move. Running game imrpoved by leaps and bounds. Made brady more comfortable throwing on 2nd and 3rd downs.   Respect Belchick for the move _/\_THIS is the shit sports documentarians masturbate to at night.  Holy fuck...Teams with 19+ point lead after 3 quarters in NFL playoff history have now gone 93-1.  Tom Brady: The 1 in 93-1I hate it when evil triumphs.Booing the fuck out of Goodell lmao [:\)](http://imgur.com/a/H9iEg)they been waiting all game to suck his dick. holy fuckI don't like the Pats, but I am half tempted to order the Super Bowl DVD so I can have a copy of the greatest super bowl ever played.Tom Brady is good at footballTom fucking Brady omg this commercial was shown in Boston right after the game: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRCA_LiLxk GOATCan we talk about that Brady fake on that two point conversion? Dude had me thinking it was a botched snap. Guy is amazing.  That and 2 two point conversions to be clutcher that clutch...This was a game to watch if you are a football fan. The Falcons came to play tonight. Unfortunately for them, so did Belichick and Brady. The Falcons made their point about how much they wanted this thing and what they were willing to do to take it. But at the end of the day, they were pawns in the 6D chess match that Belichick was playing against himself. The greatest Super Bowl ever.  And I'm a Browns fan.From a neutral perspective, what a great game to watch!   This was definitely a Super Bowl that experience mattered more than talent. Atlanta played great to build a big lead but seemed to start celebrating too early and didn't have that killer instinct to keep going for the throat.   If New England had been the one with a 25 point lead, they'd have ended up winning by 40 points. Call them the evil empire if you must, but they absolutely know how to close games out. Tom Brady: undefeated against birds in the Super Bowl. Marky Mark left the game at half time, and has now been disowned by Boston. OMFG, the boos for Goodell are amazing.This comment will probably be buried but that was the best sporting event I ever watched. This was all worth it seeing Goodell get boo-bombed like that.We had to suffer through the shittiest playoffs in history for this?  Totes fucking worth it.They should check to see if the overtime coin was fully inflated. They lead in time of possession the whole game, by a lot. You can't be giving Brady that amount of time because he will make it happen. The Falcons have a roster that can burn clock but they just went for deep throws all game. I think at a certain point they should have switched gears and managed the clock. I can't believe how sober Kraft was. I expected him to be his normal drunken self and stab Goodell in the heart and whisper, "Tom Brady sends his regards"Atlanta was just born this way[deleted]https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRCA_LiLxk Roger that#AND THEN THE YEAHS!!! Falcons fans reading this need to grasp how depressing this comment really isMy wife, who doesn't give a fuck about the NFL, was sitting next to me during this Falcons collapse. She had no idea what was going on but she knows enough to say "Wow, if this was the Bears doing this I would probably get a hotel tonight with how your mental state would be, not gonna lie."   I just looked at her and nodded because she wasn't wrong. It strangely made me happy that we were so bad because I think I'd rather win 3 games than to lose to Super Bowl like that. How often this year did you get to say that?Dude if this had happened to the Lions I would be having a full-on meltdown right now. I feel so bad for Atlanta fans right now, they must be so sick.Saints fans are feeling pretty alright right now.At least the Bears can beat the Patriots in the superbowl. end me> Teams that held a 19+ point lead at the half in the postseason are now 93-1. Let all those sink in.  this is the craziest one to meAs much as I HATE the Patriots, I love this post!satanDidnt stop Seattle a few years back. That game was over by halftimeAt this point get your ass beat for a while and just go dicks out at the last quarter and you'll for sure win.Honestly, this was somehow even better than all of those. What a Super Bowl.Can't wait to hear Bill Burr gloat about this one tomorrow.  Edit: Surprisingly mild-mannered. That new baby is turning ol' freckles into a big softie.fuck that jar of dicksI wanted that moment so badly. I'm so glad it happenedThat catch was insane.A team lost a Super Bowl because of a once-in-a-lifetime fluke catch? Wow, that must suck.The long con. Somewhere Barry Sanders is crying reading this.The drunkest timeline. Drunk History should do an episode on himShould have ran it part 2.That's what I'm saying!!! Run, Run, field goal. Game over. Seriously I was screaming. Your at the 25. Why not ducking run 3 times and put the clock down to two minutes kick a field goal GG.   Worst playcall in history. Seems not running the ball at crunch time in the super bowl has become a thing.This is the most Bills thing in Atlanta history.       Source: 37 year old bills fan Too realNot to mention they were consistently snapping the ball with like 20 seconds on the play clock. Run the clock out, ffs!are you stupid? clearly the better option is to get sacked and then have a holding penalty smh what a poor coach you are. field goals are for pussies  /s but i hope to fucking god you knew it was sarcasm to begin with.We were talking shit about the game with 8 minutes left then YEET I almost went to bed 2 hours ago, now it's half 3 in the morning and now I don't know what to do.one of the most boring playoffs I can ever remember as well... until BRADYFADE THE FLAIRS#FUCKING FADE THE FLAIRSHe shook some hands and left the stage. It was great. yeah man, good point.  refs don't get enough love when they do it right.The fact that no one is talking about the refs means they did a fantastic job. They definitely deserve a mention AgreedThe Edlemans catch, he was right there. Perfect angle. Great calls all game though. Meme magic is real.Don't let that distract you from the fact the Falcons blew a 25 point leadI'm looking forward to the FCC complaints from this game. There were at least 8 f-bombs lolhttps://streamable.com/e4mfzI thought they said that! Nobody believes mei also enjoyed blount "you're the fucking greatest" x3Its ironic because most Atlanta fans will never watch football again.Prepare for a lot of boring games after that one.  Nothing will come close to this comeback for a while I'm sure.In fairness, that wasn't just the greatest super bowl comeback in history, it was probably one of the greatest in any game. Not many like it to be sure. Nice pick of all the games to watch!Any given Sunday, baby!Brady isn't even slowing down. People laughed at him when he was saying he'd play well into his 40s, but that's definitely how its gonna go, seems like.Atlanta ran like 20 plays all game.How do the falcons not run it three straight times after that catch, kick a field goal and ice the game?That 49er stink already rubbing off on him.It's like Belichick is just in everyone's head, and coaches just tend to have brain farts against him.  Once again, all a team has to do is hand it off to a running back the Patriots haven't been able to stop, but they go with the pass.  motherfuckers forget his last team was the browns. His speech was hilarious. You could barely hear him over how loud the boos were.I was streaming the game so my audio wasn't the best.    Was Roger Goodell getting booed like crazy? Was he practically yelling to speak over the boos?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRCA_LiLxk R o g e r T h a t Horrible Limping Golden mantled ground squirrel/r/Timnog doing gods workTIMNOG THE GIF GOATDude even looks like Matt Ryan.GOAT. There's not a doubt in my mind anymore.  This is one of those historic performances. He put the team on his back and just shredded the Falcons.  Dude's a legend.AND HE WENT TO MICHIGAN GOD DAMN IT WOOO GO BLUETom Brady is a good quarterback.Eagles, Seahawks and Falcons.  All these birds teams thinking they can beat the Patriots, when Patriots are super effective to birds because of guns.  Patriots are only weak to Giants. These assholes didn't learn a damn from the Hawks... They deserve this. RUN THE BALL.That 36 championships for NE vs. 1 for ATL infographic that they showed made me kind of sick.. I'm in Maine, I can fucking hear Massachusetts from here. We have fireworks going on in my town and some old fat dudes screaming out their windowsI live 20 minutes from Foxboro. There will be fireworks into the early morning. My dog is already hiding in the tub.YepNo they're cheering "GOOOOOOO-DELL"That's a nice lead you have there...It would be a shame If someoneFalcons deserve it for trying to throw it in the redzone with 3 minutes leftafter that Julio Jones catch, run the ball three times and kick a field goal. game over. I don't know wtf kyle Shanahan was thinking. Well what about that James White guy? He's black.  Wait...Hogan's not squirrely enough and Amendola isn't getting any younger. We need to be scouting FCS games and practice squads NOW for Jules' replacement. Those over 5'11" need not apply.     Edit: I've heard your response, and conferred with our GM. The Patriots will agree to draft Hunter Renfrow with their 7th round pick this spring. BB was unhappy that he couldn't be grabbed as a UDFA, but we're all about compromise here in NE. Well, the obvious one would be Belichick and Brady.I was asking tonight, the patriots top 3 wideouts are white. When was the last time that happened? Also is Belichick playing money ball knowing white players are undervalued? Outside of Oline and QBThe trifecta28+3=31  3 1Patriots comeback with 31 unanswered points, 3-1... Bush flipped the coin, game won on coin toss, Bush did 9/11Well I guess this is growing up *any other NFCS team excludedThe rest of the NFC South would like a wordI, a Giants fan, have to admit Brady is Goat.  Not against the giants, but against everyone else, amazing.  Basically, the Patriots are 5-Giants at the super bowl ##notmysuperbowlhttp://m.imgur.com/gallery/NQjgc89I'm just here for the "Atlanta blew a 28-3 lead" memesDON'T LET THE WARRIORS BLOWING A 3-1 LEAD DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT ATLANTA BLEW A 28-3 LEAD!!!Nowhere is safethis never gets oldthats just fucking beautifulThis sums it up so damn well.I hate footballI thought that missed XP was going to kill us at the end because I thought we'd somehow come back and be burned by that.  Shades of the Denver game last year.the key moment of the game was when you guys knocked them out of FG range that coulda put them up 2 scores.  dat Edelman catch too was fire emoji.For real. There will 100% never be a comeback that big ever again. They had a 25 POINT LEAD. How in the everliving fuck do you mess that up? Seriously, what a shit tier second half. I mean the Pats earned it, but good lord.You had one job. FuckTom and Bill will retire eventually. And then maybe they won't be as good. Hopefully.Don't forget Samuel Adams. He was the first two sport star. A Brewer and a Patriot. 4) Mel Gibson 4) Team LiquidPlus Leicester winning  Clemson over 'Bama  Nova buzzer beater  Portugal winning in OT for the Euro finals  Great year indeed for sportsTime is a flat circle."First the falcons came for their ring, and Tom Brady said, "Not today motherfucker.""You should have said "I was at home watching Gaga when get call from belichek"Wait, there are other timelines?Saints fans are pretty damn happyCame here for the first time for the memes. Why does everyone hate Brady? Is it cause he kills your dreams?> P.S. I also predicted that Tom Brady will be president one day. Make of that what you will.  Wouldn't be surprised at this point.  Tom *is* friends with the current president...Welcome to Atlanta sportsBecause Willie McGinnist is fucking awesomeI hope you enjoy disappointment.The Eagles are a good choice. We don't win much, but we care **a lot**also the most completions and passing yards by a QB, the most receptions by a receiver (or running back in this case), and the most savage roast of the NFL commissioner of all timeJames White with most catches ever in the Super BowlBetween the tuck rule and the Gruden super bowl, what made you think he was ever on your side to begin with?Big if trueNice. Jags fan? Jags fan.Sure there is. His name is **Tom Brady.**lol this is so stupid i love it.If it's any consolation, Montana is Brady's football hero too. DONT LET THIS BLOWN LEAD DISTRACT YOU THAT THE WARIORRS BLEW A 3-1 LEAD IN THE NBA FINALSThe year of the choke. The spawn of the memes. You forgot ClintonThousands, if not tens of thousands of comments trashing Brady after the first quarter saying this game would destroy his legacy.  What a turn of events.Undeniable at this point.http://i.imgur.com/bHnphix.jpgTom Brady is surely the best player of all timePerfectly put. His influence on everyone on this team is outstanding. 5 times.In my mind, he's undeniably the greatest ever after that performance. He did what Seattle forgot to do. [deleted]Falcons are my alternative champions and nobody can tell me otherwise.There is no godThey can't keep getting away with thisEvil will always triumph because good is dumb. The Empire wins againI don't think Gronk was up in the booth with him this time.Their lead was a Perfect IllusionToo lateDayummm.  I am 100% on board the fuck Roger Goodell train. This commercial delivers. There's a better version at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phY0-urez5MI thought the same thing. Shit's dark.Pretty sure the Falcons fans that frequent here are either drinking themselves blind or hanging from a noose.*Flash forward*  2/7/2019 - Chicago Tribune:  *"Safe And Sorry: Bears lose Super Bowl LIII to Pats by giving up Safety*"3 and a halfDon't trust yourself to close it out, huh?It is a little suspicious that the first thing Tom Brady did after winning was kneel and look down at the ground for a minute. He was obviously thanking Satan for keeping up his end of the bargain.Meme magic wasn't real then first OT in 51 superbowls. Id say sozip.............................................................................................................................................. FUCK YOU PATS WON YOU CUNTS FUCK GOODELLOl' Billy red tits has a new special come out a few days before the Pats win. Sonofabitch.  It was music to my ears hearing those boos.I loved how they completely shut out everything he was saying with boos.  He passes the trophy to Kraft and the whole stadium immediately turns into cheers.  Awesome. Moral of the story is "if the opponents are the Pats, run it"?>Should have ~~ran~~ run it part 2.   Sheesh, guys. Totally agree.  Like how you should run on the two yard line.From field goal range to 3rd and 33 on the 50.  In. fucking. sane.[deleted]"Super Bowl XXVII, played against the Dallas Cowboys, turned out to be a mismatch. Buffalo committed 9 turnovers en route to a 52‚Äì17 loss.

Field goals are for fucking quittersThat fucking catch just turned the game on its ear#25 POINTS IN 13 MINUTESMan, I left the party at half-time saying "I hate the Pats but I sure wish this was a closer game".

Everything's coming up Milhouse!   Edit2: Oxford comma for /u/rainandmusic - although I'd kind of like to see him eat gold like [Viserys](http://imgur.com/a/0t0Qy).They also missed Blount yelling, "You are the fucking greatest." to Brady about 4 timesOh they said it, about 100 times. [deleted]Brady found a loophole in the genie's "can't wish for more wishes" policy.  He just wished to be Tom Brady.KEEP THAT O OFF THE FIELD BY TURNING IT OVER. GENIUSI don't even know That is all on the playcalling idiots of atlanta. They deserved that loss for not managing the game in thos ecrucial moments. All I heard was BOOOOOOOOOO! And then the ginger squirrel scurried away. YupThe boos in the stand were making it tough to hear the words from his mouth into the microphone that was inches from his face.  As soon as Kraft had the trophy in his hand it erupted into cheers.isn't it just the best/worst url?I don't think we'll ever see such a successful QB ever again.Yeah agreed. I'm a die hard niner fan. Montana is life but holy fuck Brady is so awesome. GOAT got sure.Guess you have to celebrate what you can as a lions fan.Now it is 37My neighbors let off (illegal) fireworks when we won.   Tonight, we are all Massholes. Kids are still running the campus at UMO. It would be a shame if...All they need to do was score a field goal...Don't trip yourself up there, man.But he's a running back... who set a Super Bowl record for receptions.*I'm not black like Barry White,   No, I am white like Frank Black is*I'm a 5'8" 195 lb white guy with steely blue eyes. Where can I sign up?SHIETPats put up 31 unanswered too  Jesus Christ 3-1 is the international symbol for comeback nowYeah, everyone but Pats fans in this thread are devastated. Meanwhile the rest of the long forgotten  NFC South are passing out from the anemia caused by our massive erections.Edelman with the helmet catch equivalent tooThe NFL had to keep up with the NBA and MLB somehow [Breaking: Roger Goodell is still stuck at 28-3, proving the 1st stage really is denial](http://i.imgur.com/rcjzFag.jpg)Don't let the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead distract you from the fact the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the finals.It hit me hard, but as soon as I get on our sub I see "same ole Atlanta" and now I'm in tears. Fucking end me The defense went back to playing how they did during most of the regular seasonYou become complacent and the mindset changes so that you are losing when you are up by 16 points, it's bad discipline and bad coaching 101im a bears fan.  which means i have seen the packers get rid of their best coach and best qb and guess what?   fuck football. Some might say he's... *The* PatriotSorry, I don't think the browns are winning in any of the others either :/Can I Bucs fan with you on that one?It's fun to "hate" the guy at the top.Exactly. And with rumors of Peyton Manning running for Senate, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Brady one day got involved. I started following the Sixers during the process, I can take anything.That's how OP likes emGod hates JagsPraise be unto him. DONT LET THIS BLOWN LEAD DISTRACT YOU THAT THE INDIANS BLEW A 3-1 LEAD IN THE WORLD SERIESSome idiot posted a suicide hotline to /r/boston about an hour ago. Wonder if he's embarrassed or just raging right now.He did it on purpose! The absolute madlad. That's just stupid no matter how this game turned out. Even if he continued to play like crap and the Pats ended up losing, his legacy would still be pretty safe. Never talk shit till the clock hits 0Unfortunately :(     Edit: I can't believe 1999 was 23 years ago 2 more rings and he can summon the dragon, wonder what he'll wish for.He just went shotgun mode "its ok guys, I will handle this"  Stone cold fucking killer  Edit: thanks for the gold!I mean... he did pass at the 2.there is only Satan https://gfycat.com/IncomparableFlatAcornwoodpeckerExplains Eli's two rings. He didn't understand that he wasn't supposed to win. Gronk was on the sidelines.  They showed him looking sad at the end of the first halfTom Brady lives for the Applause.My level of disdain is right up there next to my hatred of 99.9% of our politicians Was he using the 5th one as a cock-ring?!?Seriously. It's like someone saying "geez, I sure do pity you. Thank god I'm only a quadriplegic with eczema." Every now and then there comes along a fuckup of such epic proportions that it temporarily drowns out the "Haha yeah but where's your ring at?" that haunts my dreams.  Thank you, Atlanta.[Go on.....](http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old-spice-guy-head-nod.gif)Damn dude....Satan gives us more titles?   In that case... hail Satan?  *shrugs*  Hail Satan. Everyone knows that meme magic wasn't properly controlled until 2015this is actually really incredible, knowing that there's no OT in the previous 50The biggest comeback of a winning team was 10 pts in a Super Bowl before this game...  Hell of a game  I wanted to sleep by halftime, glad I didn't .........RECRIUTAHBill probably turned it off at halftime haha the hot head he isnot to mention his week old kidI can never escape this That's why I agree with that. The Seahawks still needed to gain two yards in 1 play. The falcons just needed to run the clock.   Hell even a kneel down would have been better. Yes. That's us...Luckily we have several different scenarios that led to Super Bowl losses, not to mention we play the pats 2x a year so we can mix and match every type of loss.  And then they broke their own record and lost again to the Cowboys the following year.This is maybe the most heartbroken I've ever been and that says somethingBut you have to go for it on 4th down because punts are for fucking normies.That's the catch everyone will talk about instead of Julio Jone's insane acrobatics soon before. Why Brady is the GOATLook what you did. You. Singlehandedly. [deleted]I didn't miss thatshould have said it 5 timesWhen it is not fun anymore. Looks like it still is atmI think lots of people have gone from hating Brady because he keeps winning to being in awe of Brady because he keeps winning.   Seriously, at some point we have to recognize that we have been witnessing the best QB our sport has ever seen and just appreciate the amazing game play.  I mean, 7 SB appearances in 15 years. At least all other teams get a chance every other year.BB playing 4D Chess confirmed In a weird way that sort of helped, Atlanta's defense was running on fumes by the end because of the lopsided time of possession.And Kraft was like "how's this feel bitch?"Not from a Jedi you won't. Imagine if niners drafted local boy BradyHey we gave you Woodson and Howard chillIn a row?Someone............patriots...Just show up outside of Gillette tomorrow and look squirrely. BB will find you. I texted my boy like "there may be a new "the catch" If the Patriots win"  Needless to say there is a new "the catch"Your move, NHLDON'T LET OHIO STATE GETTING SHUT OUT AGAINST CLEMSON DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT THE ATLANTA FALCONS BLEW A 28-3 LEAD IN THE SUPER BOWL.I mean, I hate you guys....but I gotta say, I actually feel bad for y'all. The Falcons will go down as the biggest chokers in sports history. I don't think I could handle that as a fan.I was telling the people I watched with not to underestimate the ability of Atlanta sports to choke. At least you get to watch us choke in the playoffs. "no way PFM gets a higher office than me"Brady vs Manning 2032 for the PresidencyGood man, you'll fit it in wellDONT LET THIS DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT KANSAS BEAT TEXAS or on the phone?At least he knows what number to dial.Oh no he lost after making it to 7 Superbowls. What a shit legacy! /s  Morons...But now Tom is a perfect 5/7 in the Super BowlHonestly, we all knew the Falcons were never getting the ball back because of Brady.Protect Brady, win games. I swear the last 10 minutes of the 4th it was nothing but empty back field sets. [deleted]I was half expecting Gronk to come out after the first half and them cut to Bill on the sidelines with his classic not smirk smirk. That would be classic Bill faking em out. Tom Brady's busy scoring 25 points in 13 minutes, you're not gonna reach his telephone.As a bears fan who is a paraplegic I fully understand As a fellow Eagles fan...yesI mean its the Bears, obviously in this world Shea Mcclelin Sacked Jay Cutler 4 times including the game winning safety.If the Satan theory is true, it also means Brady, Belichick and Kraft will get one more Super Bowl win so that they'll each have respectively 6,6,6 wins. It's amazing to me that it hasn't happened until today. I also wonder how much the last half of the game will be "studied" or replayed. Oooooooh Ba-doo-doo-doo Me undies, me undies.....  Winnin the Supah Bowl ba-doo-doo Me undies, me undiessssss....  Atlanta just had to throw...  You get Tom Brady's finger in your ass, and the somethin somethin somethin large mouth bass oh yeah!you can never out-run it  I can't believe the Pats made the same mistake that won them a Super Bowl. If it would have been intercepted the irony would have been so sweet.AY WE BEAT THE PAT'S THIS YEAR THO LET'S GO BOYZAfter Julio's catch I was all "wow that's the greatest catch I've ever seen". Then Edelman made his catch and I was like "okay, now THAT'S the greatest catch I've ever seen"Julio is still not human.  His catches were out of this world.  üêê What a dick"5/7 would play again."I was saying this after the game.  The Pats had that long drive that ended in the pick 6 and they immediately followed that with another long drive.  The Falcons D played really well and then they were just gasping for air.Have you ever heard the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise?Need Belichick. Go hand in hand.Feels like itTry not to win any championships on your way to the parking lot!Made a comeback!and "The Drive" IMOwhy you gotta bring that up man?Manning would win in a landslide.  New England doesn't have enough electoral votes.I LIKE YOUR COMMENT BUT HATE YOUR FLAIR WHAT DO I DOI actually saw someone post a few days ago that Montana's 4-0 record was better than Brady's 4-2 record "because Montana never lost a Super Bowl".  That just means Montana lost more earlier in the playoffs than Brady. Why would that make him better?Haha holy shit. Do memes run the world now? [deleted]As soon as we won the toss I knew we had it. Brady was in straight up kill mode at that point. dude threw it 62 times and was ready to keep throwing. and he's 39.They almost picked it off too No offense, but I may have yelled "don't be the Seahawks" at my TV.A bills fan...I'll just be RIGHT over here :/Brady about to bookend his career with a second 3/4 SBs. The throw that resulted in the loss of field goal range for the Falcons i the last quarter is what did it.  All the Falcons had to do was run it that play pick up a couple yards and make the field goal at about the 50 yard line. Confirmed, Bills essentially Super Bowl LI champions!With your flair?We will have statues erected in his nameAre the other two when Eli gets involved?You mean Bill Belichick?I thought not. It's not a story Goodell would teach you. No idea why you're being downvoted. They're the greatest HC-QB tandem ever by a mile. Neither would be as successful without the other.Agree. Bill is a mastermind and sees talent overlooked by others. Srsly, how many Patriots stars over the years were cut by other teams?I'm glad you guys had this.https://i.reddituploads.com/035bf004848a460e8d5fa25b5a5f68d9?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=050ba535ec7e3be369315ad02b32e39fHell, one runs the United States[deleted]One of the reasons I can fully appreciate this Patriots dynasty.Yeah, the reason why I'm not scared of him dropping off quite yet is because he's that freak QB who's arm gets *better* the more he throws usually. At his age that's insane. The throws he was making it OT were straight dimes. I was so fucking angry when he dropped back, let alone lofted that fucker. So I'm certainly not an expert in football management, but I'm totally bamboozled by the way that the Falcons were able to steamroll the Pats for most of the game, but then end up blowing it by apparently making terrible calls. What the hell happened? Then the Pats start running these plays and you could see it in the faces of the Falcons players - they were totally stonefaced and didn't seem to know what to do. Who blew it, and why?All the Pats had to do was miss one of the two point conversions, or not get a touchdown, or turn it over once, or miss the field goal, or miss a tackle, or ...  Everything had to come together for them to come back. They had to execute on every play and they did.He must be young. It's kind of funny. The Julio catch is honestly one of the best throw-catch combinations, right up there with Manning-Manningham for me.  In both the Brady-Edelman and Eli-Tyree throws, the throws themselves were pretty bad. Eli's was a 1 on 1 jump ball in the middle of the field while Brady's actually gets tipped up and had a real chance at getting intercepted. However, the WR ends up making a ridiculous catch on the ball that plays a huge role in leading a comeback. it's always tough to judge which is a "better" catch: The technically amazing one or the absolutely unbelievable one. When he defeats Eli, his task is complete.He could influence the midicholorians to create  *evil head turn*  Super Bowl comebacks.Even cooler.  How many Patriots "stars" did Bill cut and then they turned out to be purely products of a good system once they were on their new teams who overpaid for them.Yep, great to see the lions flair finish that string"Don't let your memes stay dreams." -Tom Brady  \-Michael ScottAnd for only 4 mana tooI love that we can love this more than any other fanbase aside from the pats. Bill Belichek is the master of mid- to late-game adjustments.That's what it looks like to get out-coachedThe stakes of both catches were insane,  One to take down the undefeated favorites  One to keep the greatest Superbowl comeback aliveHe won't retire he'll just blink out of existenceHow does one learn such a power?This is the last place I expected to find a 4 mana 7/7 meme.Unfortunately I feel like the Falcons now have their own Tyree Catch[deleted]I'm anxiously waiting for an epic documentary on The Belichick era of the Pats franchiseTerrible haiku, 9-12-13, the hell kind of meter is that?Not from a Falcon  *music swells*I finally know how it feels to have a catch like that... It feels good.I would pay a good bit of money to know what he was writing.It's gonna be a damn good 30 for 30After tonight expect a max budget Disney flick starring Mark Wahlberg as Brady Terrible haiku.   9, 12, 13, the hell kind   Of meter is that?     Whoaright? now when anyone questions it defend with your fucking life that it was 100% skill. because fuck them you won the superbowl. 
r/nfl, Best self deprecating humorHe guides others to a treasure he cannot possess Tony Romo should be the next Batman.Romo is unique in that as a player he was so polarizing, but as a commentator everyone loves him. Honestly, I hope he enjoys what he's doing, he seems like such a good dude.To make matters worse, just look where he ranks on the all time list for Passer rating among QB's with >100 career starts      1. Rodgers 103.1   2. Wilson 100.3   3. Brees 97.7   4. Brady 97.6   5. Romo 97.1    6. S. Young 96.8   7. P.

The Tony Goes to the Super Bowl thing earlier today was good. He's so charismatic. Just wait until he's the head coach of the CowboysIRATE OVER THE LACK OF SWEET VICTORYTony Romo is my all time favorite NFL player.Are we just going to post everything romo says and does today?‚ÄúBlah blah blah no one‚Äôs scoring touchdowns‚Äù I laughed my ass offBest announcer the NFL has ever had.Yes, I too am watching Good for him. He didn‚Äôt make it as a player, but he is best at his craft as an announcer, and made it anyway. I hope this isn‚Äôt bittersweet for him, he earned this. Makes me so sad that we couldn‚Äôt get him there.  I love how Jim jinxed the fg Romo seems like what a fan would be if we actually knew what we were talking about.As someone who has hated Romo most of his career because he played for Dallas, I have come to adore him so much this year. I did not expect to grow to like him as much as I did. This line almost made me want him to have a ring. Almost. Part of me wants to tell all the cowboys haters he‚Äôs ours. The rest of me does too. Dez caught it.That's just depressingMost boring super bowl and worst commercials ever.Worst game I ever seen Romo is a top notch commentator. Make its quite laughable to see how much better he is than Joe buck. This Romo love in the comments makes me so happy. I don't understand how people think this is boring. This is an tense as it gets. A defensive powder keg. Every yard is crucial.It was a catch!Was there a prop bet on him saying this? This makes me sadRomo is a giftNow has the most coveted job in his field, I'm sure he's fine.  That's my Quarterback.Romo refuses to take Ls. Thought of saying Tony finally in Super Bowl but he outplayed me üò≠As a lifelong giants fan I never thought I‚Äôd say it - I think Tony Romo is the man. Dude is by far best commentator! Could see coaching in his near future.I picked romo during several fantasy seasons, he always did well for me.You da real SB mvp, Romo.Romo is a good announcer. i like that he explains why or why not a play should happen. he and Nantz are a good team. Romo is a damn good announcer tho...F:(I could not stand Romo as a QB but as an announcer he's Awesome.Jessica Simpson is really missing out on the most successful part of Tony‚Äôs career Love how Romo is such a good sport about roasting himself. Cowboys fans could learn alot from him.i know i just watched thatWheres sweet victoryGo Romo!!!At least Andy had a good burger As someone who doesn't follow NFL, what does this mean?Hopefully he'll be able to hoist his own trophy once he becomes a coach I loved that. Romo‚Äôs commentary was fantastic. gosh, i love Romo. üò≠üò≠I had a blast telling all of my friends, who don't care about football, all about this joke and nobody cared but I thought it was hilarious. This is a shout-out to all of the others who were in a similar situation.That's our boy. He has always been my favorite player. ‚≠êRomo better be on the next Madden commentating The true MVP of Super Bowl 53Romo made the most boring nfl game of the season bearable... give that man a medal.Despised Romo the QB, love Romo the announcerLove this dude! Hated him as a QB but great human being right thereRomo is terrific and I love his commentary. Romo was the only good part of the game.A lot of comments on here about how this was a terrible game.   To be honest, this is what football really looks like. It‚Äôs not throwing for 500+ yards and running up the score like last year‚Äôs super bowl was. This was a super bowl of years past and to be honest, it was really refreshing to see some good damn defense for once. Add in the fact that both teams had to chip away and make moves and counter moves. I haven‚Äôt seen a better game played in a long time. [deleted]r/suicidebywordsFr/suicidebywords If I was ESPN, I'd back up the brinks truck. I freakin love Tony RomoHah, that self-deprecating humour is great. :D Romo's one interesting announcer!The best commentating ever. I love this comboThat was classic Romo. I want to golf with that guy. Romo, you on Reddit bro?oofRomo should have gotten the MVP for this one.Damn, now i wish Romo covered all the superbowls. His analysis was great, even when things didn't pan out exactly. That touchdown series for the Pats he called it, when Brady saw the matchups with Gronk, saying that they would run the same play, and they did three times in a row when Jules caught one in the middle, and then the deep seam to Gronk to set things up at the 2.Honestly he was born to be a broadcaster. Hated this guy as a player... Love him as an announcer.   Seriously a joy to listen to him dissect stuff and pretty personable too. Don‚Äôt let that game distract you from the fact Tom Brady was suspended for deflating footballs, Bill Bellichick received a $500,000 fine for stealing plays, and Julian Edelman was suspended for four games for taking Performance Enhancing Drugs.Sad!He‚Äôs probably better in this role than a QB. He was a great QB but a fantastic color commentator. The punter with the most yards should be MVP. Not joking.#boringsuperbowlDuck Maroon 5. We wanted Sweet VictoryIf Romo were honest on LA‚Äôs last drive he‚Äôd have said ‚Äúright here I‚Äôd bobble the snap and cause a turnover.‚ÄùPost worthyThis sucks why can‚Äôt i access the rest of this subBoring"Do you do this every year? I wouldn't know."I was listening to NPR Friday Morning and Steve Inskeep said, "Tony Romo finally made it to the Superbowl."

Never thought I‚Äôd say that about Romo.Romo over Goff When that was the most interesting moment in the superbowl Best part of the Superbowl tbh.How does an NFL reporter not know that Super Bowl is two words?!I am happy for my favorite childhood athlete If he would've played for the pats he might've gotten himself a few champs.Best thing about thid game was Romo! Green Bay should hire him to coach.Romo really was the SB MVPHe still can as a coach, if his ability to call out plays before they happen actually means something FI love Romo behind the booth!He is the best part of this awful game/r/suicidebywords"It's gonna be a fun one today, Jim."  The only Romo prediction to be wrong. Well atleast here is there with his old coach*cries in Dallas Cowboy*[deleted]r/inthesoulstone is leakingRomo and Wade Phillips finally made a Super Bowl together This actually works with Tom completing the Infinity Gauntlet lolDamn...at first I laughed...but then like, why not? He's huge and in shape and comfortable in front of a camera. Throw a gruff voice on him and why the fuck not?The commentor we deserve but not the QB we need right now.[deleted]Honestly why not? Is one of Batman‚Äôs responsibilities being the OC/HC of the Dallas Cowboys? If so, I subscribe I read that as Bateman and still thought he'd fit https://imgur.com/a/FPytj4eGronk for Bane 2019!this is starting to make an uncomfortable amount of senseHe was chillin with Aaron Rodgers at the NFL Honors... Maybe he can be Robin?Make it happen Reddit! Better than Nick Jonas. https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ad7nkw/game_thread_los_angeles_chargers_124_at_baltimore/edef3ci/  Wow, I got 5 upvotes for saying that a month ago but you got 7k? Nice timing.Looks more like daredevil. He even hears plays before they happen.Damn, you're right... I wasn't a huge fan of his while he was playing, but I'm a HUGE fan of his commentary during these games!  I loved how he was throwing friendly jabs about how the Superbowl was so low scoring and the Rams couldn't get any first downs, at one point even saying "damn this getting hard to watch" when LA missed a bunch of consecutive 3rd down conversions... Even though I was cheering for the Rams, his jabs and jokes were making the game actually tolerable to watch  Edit -- I also laughed out loud when the Rams tied it at 3-3 and he was like "holyyy we got ourselves a scoring spree!" He is. His grandparents live in a nearby town and sometimes Tony comes to SoTx to visit. When anybody outside the family gets wind of it everyone wants to meet him. He's always been really cool. He hasn't changed though. It's biased because I'm an eagles fan, but half the reason I hated him was *because* he was so chipper and smooth, but on the Cowboys. Never good enough to be great, but smart enough to keep his team alive when neededSeems that way. I didn‚Äôt like him as a player but he quickly became my favorite commentator. So Cutler would be good in the booth too lmaoGlad he dated Jessica Simpson when he did. He deserved so much more than what happened with Dallas every year. Y u do disThere's a reason Jerry feels responsible Tony never won oneWho‚Äôs #8?Same. He was our quarterback once :‚Äô)Tony Romo is the John Madden of announcers I want my son to grow up remembering.Crazy to think that at this rate, he'll almost definitely be remembered first as a great announcer, second as a former Cowboys QB.He's really growing on meI don‚Äôt understand the Romophobes out thereI love him to, no Romo. Thanks me 2Mavs legendAre you a Romosexual?I hate Dan Snyder more. Don't forget the dimples the size of the Marianna's trench.Anyone have a link to this?He's too authentic and grounded for TV. Actors are fake and plastic.I don't mean to get overly sentimental but if he had a podcast I'd listen to it.The Adventures of Romo and Cutty   Who says no Rather him be in the booth forever.Please god no, I want to keep liking him. The Cowboys don't deserve that good fortune, especially not from Romo after how they kicked him to the curb.Yes please.Same buddy. Same. WordIt‚Äôs the Super Bowl so most likely yes Yep.The message came down from the heavens  "Yeah"Its better than the commercials He's the most exciting thing about this game right now. And that record breaking punt. My friends and I all jumped out of our seats and gave each other high fives. Just kidding. I'm watching the game alone at home. Yes because it‚Äôs quality commentating and we‚Äôre not used to it for the most part. That goes for all sports. Finally got a guy doing a good job so blame the shitty commentators for us liking Romo. We‚Äôre just happy. Nostraromo predicted you would say thatAll these flavors and you choose salty. Not much else going on in the game.You‚Äôre just sour bc you didn‚Äôt have him on the call last year while you guys were there üòèI hope so!Si"If you like offense, well this isn't the game for you. If you like defense, I guess you like it."Get out, you get CBS too?I appreciate the post because this is hilarious and the place I'm at is way too loud to hear a single thing being said on the tv, and I'm sure I'm not the only one in that situation.[deleted]Pff. This?Oh good he just wanted to make sure you didn‚Äôt miss it When he retired he was #2 passer rating in NFL history. I think he did pretty well "as a player". It takes more than just being a good QB. You need a team a coaching staff around you too. I used to hate Romo until he started commentating now I hope he doesn‚Äôt go away. Romo was definitely good enough. It takes a team and good coaching to go to the super bowl.He‚Äôs a strategist. He could probably become a coach if he really wanted.If we ever had the kind of team around him like we do for Dak now he would've made at least one. Probably several. He carried those teams more than the Cowboys fanbase ever gave him credit forWhat made it even better was Romo calling him out about it. "Awwww, Jim, don't jinx him!"As a fellow Niners fan...same, same. He's fantastic. Dallas shouldn‚Äôt have been in that game anyway. Detroit got robbedBut at least he's not getting a ringI'll upvote this every time.Oh god joe buck is like nails on a chalkboard. Plus his beard is awkward.Joe Buck isn't the color commentator though... so I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. He is better than Troy Aikman though.Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt feel to bad for him. That‚Äôs a gig that‚Äôll last his whole life, or at least as long as he wants. Tony Romo was a QB in the league for many years. He played for the Cowboys, and they never got to the Super Bowl romo was a quarterback who never went to a super bowl Room was a quarterback for Dallas for ~10 years before becoming a commentator. He was pretty good but never made it to the Super Bowl as a player.Go home, stay safe, and good night.He was waiting since conception Thank Christ this abysmal game wasn't on Fox. It would've been unwatchable. I was thinking this very same thing, he‚Äôs awesome üëè I loved him getting on Nance for the missed field goal.i feel like this isn't quite suicide. Maybe /r/CutWristByWordsI missed it why was it great?Good thing I didn‚Äôt get snappedHe should TM this6 foot 2? Check  Over 200 pounds? Check  Athletic? Check  Rich? Check  Good with women? Check  No powers? Check I was going to say that you need to act well to be Batman, but then I remembered that Batman & Robin was a thing.And he has a good chin!Gronk plays Robin Uh. He sounds like he smoke cigars rolled in sand paper. I think he has the gruff voice thing down.   Edit: my spelling is shitFuck the grim dark Batman. Romo could be the modern Adam West and he'd be believable. Lolhttps://imgur.com/a/ElCGY2A  I'm batmanBruce Wayne spoke normally when he wasn't in the suit.Pls no It will be a little awkward shooting his parentsBatman doesn't wear Sketchers reeeeeeeeeeeMaybe he already is.Dirtiest in pocket backspin in the game till Mahomes came alongYes, he needs to be the next Dr. Who. ImmediatelyI‚Äôm thinking Batman would be DC.Romo would still be a great Patrick Bateman if only he had a bunch of underlying rage and brutality bubbling under the surface. Nailed it.lol damn no kidding. R/NFL is weird like that.  Have another upvote my dude!I liked the ones about potential MVPs being special teams players and how they are household names lolI liked when he circled the 8 'punts' in a row for the people watching at homeMy favorite was when he highlighted mark barron's fake blitz in order to get a one on one pass blocking opportunity for Aaron Donald.  It just highlighted what NFL defensive coordinators try and do when they disguise blitzes.  My favorite is when he just started going "blah blah blah" when saying over and over again how awful the rams were doingTo prove Romo belongs in the HoF8: Rivers   9: Ryan(if Falcons fans haven't suffered enough)   10: Roethlisberger       11: Warner   12: Montana     That's the full list of guys above 90 with >100 career games. So you've got Romo, 9 superbowls winners, a 9-time father, and one guy who decided to start tanking for the draft mid 3rd quarter of the Superbowl  Was he as loved then?He‚Äôs always my QB. And thus, by extension, America's Quarterback.What do you mean man? He‚Äôs always gonna be our quarterback. Once a cowboy always a cowboy. I don't really enjoy watching football because I don't understand what's going on. I've tried learning plays and routes but it all just ends up a blur to me. I don't know any strategies or tactics but when I listen to Tony Romo he actually makes sense of it all for me. He's just a dude that's talking about something he seems to have a wealth of inside knowledge about and it's the best. I actually really enjoy watching football when it's him because I understand what's going on at different levels.It's funny because I always loved him as a player but I know the same can't be said for all Cowboys fans... but if he explains NFL football to the masses and people love him for it, I'll be OK with that too, I'm just glad he's being appreciated as opposed to constantly shit on... regardless of what he's being appreciated forLike Dandy Don?And that's sad as fuck because in my opinion he's the greatest Dallas QB of all time.BUT WHAT ABOUT FRIED CHICKEN?I hate Joe Buck more.https://twitter.com/DWStraka49/status/1092198871273533440?s=20His sketchers commercial was pretty goodAnd ever. And how good natured he was about itIts romo so yesRight now it's more interesting then the game! Good.  This is more his moment than the teams playing.Only fitting for eagles fans to complain about Romo again. MmmhmmLook at Romo compared to people like Smoltz with baseball just spending the whole broadcast with "back in mah day...." whining.  Massive differenceneighbor gets CBS but says he pays less because it‚Äôs diesel Nah dog, /r/nflstreamsPretty sure he meant he didn‚Äôt make it to the super bowl, not that he was bad. Who was 1?\*3rd.  Wilson had passed him by thenSame. He adds great content to the game and brings you into the logistics more as a fan. I hope he stays sharp. I hope he keeps watching tape, keeping up on what plays teams are doing, and just continues to add to the knowledge base he draws from now. I really hope he doesn‚Äôt go the way of Madden where he just starts rambling because he no longer has something substantial to add.   I worry precisely because he no longer has that coaching staff around him feeding him information.  I hope he‚Äôs good enough by now to do it on his own and to be able to draw from the resources he has at the network. You give him any other gm/owner than Jerry and he goes a lot further. Glad I'm not the only one defending Romo.Exactly, people would love to bash Tony for coming up short or getting injured when he was literally carrying his team for years. No wonder he has a bad back.  If he had a great oline, Zeke and a great defense like they do now he would have a couple rings no doubt.Lmao yeah then he was like ‚Äúwell you did it again‚ÄùGuys I felt the same way about Eli Manning last year. I am a die hard Pat's fan who wanted him dead twice on the field but last year the way he got railroaded and all that stuff. Then the Superbowl dance commercial almost had me tears. Dude is just Eli, a great man and a great legacy Detroit was holding on the same play they got "robbed" onDon't forget the holding by DetroitYeah it wasn't their three 2nd half turnovers (with back to back fumbles on their final drive), the 3 total points they scored in the 2nd half, or the defensive collapse that led to their loss.Fucking gold for this comment. LmaoDetroit got robbed. Dallas got robbed. Packers blew it in Seattle. Seattle should of ran it.  Weird NFC postseason all aroundWitten also got blatantly held on a key 3rd down, but people don't talk about it because the cowboys ran the same play and got a first down on 4th. Also, that one play would not guarantee that Detroit even score, much less win the game. Dez's catch was at a key moment close to the end of the game. And, that TE was grabbing Hitchens facemask anyways. Why did you gild yourself?Detroit, Dallas, Packers and Seattle. It was like the winner of each game was cursed to lose the next in even more heartbreaking fashion.Watched the game at home, thanks!Now could you imagine, special guest Jason Whitten?MAAAATTTTTYYYYY  how's your super bowl going?I don‚Äôt feel so good. Broken back? Check  Edit: oh shit, my first gold! You're all beautiful people. Even the Vikings fans.No super bowl rings? CheckPretty sure romo has precognition as a superpower, can‚Äôt be batman.What about his parents?!Self deprecating humor? CheckHow are his parents doing? Can take a pounding? Nope, injuredHe maybe has psychic powers. So: No powers? Check...? Nipples? CheckAre we just gonna pretend Jessica Simpson didn‚Äôt happen?His power is prediction. He knows all the moves you will make. Any word on his parents' well-being?Batman Reboot. NFL Commentator by day, vigilante by night.https://imgur.com/a/ElCGY2ABroken back?

Facts he could drop it in a bucket along the sideline Cue outrage that the next Dr. Who is American.D(allas) C(owboys)   &#x200B;  Let the man dream!God damn it. Hahahaha I forgot about that!  Romo got jokes Hahaha my pops laughed so hard when he did that I doubt he ever gets that but all the haters are first round ballot for the hall of shame He does not.\*sigh\*  In our own house too.  This was supposed to be the year!>and one guy who decided to start tanking for the draft mid 3rd quarter of the Superbowl  Thats a bold strategy Cotton.By some of us. He was also given a lot of grief. Yes. I'm still mad he wasn't given a chance to start after coming back from his back injury. Dak shouldve sat behind Romo when Romo was ready to return. Idgaf that they were 10-1Yes By me, yeah. He was frustrating to watch but he gave the trash bag teams we‚Äôve had a gambler‚Äôs chance. Not even close. I‚Äôve always been a fan, but during his playing time he was always so hated. Now that he‚Äôs gone though everybody seems to love him again. It‚Äôs weird. Not a Cowboys fan but I moved to Dallas when Dak came up. I couldn't believe the amount of hate Romo got. You want to talk about crappy QB's, I'm a Texans fan.By me yeah My friend I was watching the game with said the same thing. He never watches football unless I have it on and says it‚Äôs much more engaging with Romo announcingthese kids have no idea who you are talking about.üñï, Joe Buck!

"Who are you rooting for?"  "Romo"Best performance of the night so far. (Barely beating out Edelman.)I love watching and listening to Romo as a commentator, he‚Äôs my favorite one. He‚Äôs been the highlight of the night!Eagles Fans complain about everytime, even themselves*laughs in EV*r/NotKenMWell my neighbor gets CBS, so I'm just watching through his window...naked...with my dick in my hand Ah, I think you're right. My bad. Nathan PetermanRodgers He barely even had Demarco Murray. ‚ÄòTis a pity.I thought it was a facemask[deleted]so replay downsDez also ran onto the field with no helmet.  At the time that was a 15yrd penalty automatic 1st. That wasn't called either.  But it's ok all of the NFC for hilarious fucked after.  Dez not catching it  Packers unable to hold a lead   And butler's  INT.  That was a weird playoff.Then they should have gotten to replay the down. Y'all still benefited from a ludicrous fuckup by the refs.I gilded himI didn‚Äôt Going great brotha!! The pats fans in the family are in ATL, and I came to visit! Watching the game and posting highlights in my cousins apartment while they‚Äôre at the game haha  How you doin my man-Sean McVay *probably*Holy shit lol.https://imgur.com/a/ElCGY2Aoh, my brother, you wound me.Seemed like his entire career everyone was wondering what would break first: his spirit, or his bodySo fucked up and funny.Knightfall. Nice...Batman as an OC or DC would be unfair though.[deleted]Cast NFL players as comic characters:  Romo - Batman  Brady - ThanosSo, what you're saying is Romo should play an older live-action Spider-Man at some point.On my way to their house with an axe right now[https://i.imgur.com/3mjhfj9.gif](https://i.imgur.com/3mjhfj9.gif)No, villain can be Kermit. Well there's the issue;  He's supposed to throw it to players *on the field*At least you didn't have to watch Brees play in or win it in Atl? I guess.I went to a Stars game where Tony was in attendance and shown on the Jumbotron, and he was booed by the whole stadium. Unfortunately he was given a lot of grief and caught a lot of flak in public. There is also a such thing as good grief‚Ä¶just ask Charlie BrownI always liked Tony. I got good and tired of hearing about the fumbled snap in *2006*. Look at the stats. They don't lie.  I keep telling people, Troy Aikman admitted on TV that Romo was a better QB that he was. Troy had the team around him that he needed to succeed; Romo didn't until it was almost too late. Then Dez caught it but the refs said he didn't.   Tony Romo is arguably the best QB who never went to the Super Bowl.Id say most of us. Like80%That last TD to TWill üò≠. It's hard to fault him when he carried the teams that had terrible defenses and would put up like 30 to 40 points a game and still lose.He's such a smarmy little shit.   Then you pair him with a guy that has trouble putting together sentences regularly.  Worst announcing team in footballCuz im gonna love youTouchdownhonestly doens't sound like a bad ramen dish tbhHell Yeah.  Not even a little bit exaggerating. He's my biggest reason for watching tonight.Romo for SB MVP.Even as an NFCE rival fan, I'm rooting for Romo over either team tonight. Credit where credit is due, and he's just more likeable than anyone else in that stadium- especially Kraft and Kroenke.Credit where it's due -- both defenses are at least doing pretty alright.That's cool. Can we pitch in to buy his neighbor an antenna?Not a big deal. I read it that way at first too. I am fucking crying laughingWho?It was. Your tight end held the facemask of Hitchens until the ball was close to arriving.Nice dude!  Hosting here; my family and my wife's; got about 18 people here. Buffalo wings, BBQ ribs, spinach dip, chili, and a myriad of desserts.   And I'm drinking.   Can't beat it. He's plowin yer mah! What else? ^^/sMore like the Rams place kicker-Jared GoffDeductive prediction abilities?  Check.Holy smokes, Batman!I appreciate the effort, however minimalThat‚Äôs my quarterback That cowl was obviously made for Peyton Manning, though. I'd watch that movie lolHis body broke first. His spirit broke at that press conference :(Batman is DCThat would make a fantastic comic book short. Who wins, Bill Belichick or Batman with 1 week prep time.A whole week of prep time? Opponents wouldn't stand a chance...https://imgur.com/a/ElCGY2AIf only the rules of today had been in place in 2014... would have been another chance of Romo vs. Seattle.Brady = Capt AmericaIf we‚Äôre just doing people involved with sports we know Steve kerr is thanos  Edit: thanos was autocorrected to thanksNdominic Suh for Thanos I think, Brady‚Äôs more of a Raz-Al-Guhl.You need to Chill.NOT NOW!!But the ones on the sidelines are wide open!That would have absolutely been the worst timeline.  No doubt.  LAR winning the NFCCG was a blessing.I always liked him. Cowboys fans can be so fickle. I live in Dallas and grew up here. Cowboys fans were brutal to Romo. At times it was a bit understandable but they were constantly so harsh on him and hyper critical. Everything was always his fault at the end of the day. I think since he retired there‚Äôs been some self reflection and they‚Äôve realized how good he was.That showed who and what Tony Romo was. And should have silenced his detractors. But I still see "RoMo wAs A cHoKeR"Forever and everUnbelievable Romo deserved a better game.*looks at score*  'pretty alright' sounds golden my guy. Game has been awful, but can't beat good food and football!! Or whatever we're watchingThat‚Äôs my vigilante üò≠Where? All I see is a picture of Batman. You made me spit beer all over my phone. All too easy.This makes Belichick penguin?**WE'RE ON TO GOTHAM**Belicheck parks a semi in front of the Bat Cave, cuts the crotch out of the bat suit and underwear. It‚Äôs Belichick not Andy Reid, Batman wins./r/whowouldwin[deleted]Brady ain't out here collecting rings for nothing.  Cap would be someone on the lineIf Kerr is Thanos....what does that make Michael Jordan? Joe chillHey that's Mr. Freeze's line!Especially the ones who are also Yankee fansI think most of us liked him. Look at the career qb ratings. The only people ahead all time are Brees, Brady, Rodgers, and Wilson. The stats reflect well in his skills. Romo was a much better passer than Prescott tooVery well put. Nah - this kind of game actually helped make him the natural center of focus.  I don't hear the commentators at all when the game is intense.Well I did say 'at least.'  Understatement's underrated.We're watching an exemplary punting performance from both teams.That's my Batman! And when y'all say things like that it's unfair!.....it's unfair....Hopefully it's waterproofThe mad hoodieI laughed out loud manAmen brotha. Here's to hoping he becomes the Broncos head coach in the next 5 years. The Cowboys don't deserve him.Ahh yes, the : Cowboy, Yankee, Golden State fan. A Dime a dozen those are.Come on man I‚Äôm from NY and a cowboys/Yankees fan. We aren‚Äôt all band wagoners. I‚Äôve been a fan of both since ‚Äò81 and that was passed down from my father. I get the joke, but it‚Äôs not all of us.Anybody who was actually paying attention to the Cowboys seemed to like him. Casual fans who were just parroting the media were the ones that dogged him. If Romo had won just one super bowl I bet he would be in the discussion as one of the top 5 or 6 QBs of all time. Definitely in the top 10.He had a history of early exits from the play offsHa, true. Can you guys have sex nowThis is some r/wholesome caliber stuff. Love it.bud light?Mr. Freeze. [deleted]In college, I knew a Cowboy, Yankee, and Heat/ Cavs fan. He called me a bandwagonner. See flair for reference. Cowboy Yankee Lakers*Don't forget Bama And Red Wings And don't have a Hockey team because it's harder to find on TV.Why would you still be a Cowboys fan if you're a glory hunterYour timeframe seems off. Bulls would have been better. THIS RIGHT HERE...I couldn't have said it any better.As a Broncos fan since I was 9 and being a born and raised Texan, I always felt so bad for Romo being hated by many Dallas fans. I would have loved him on Denver for any of his years. Still wished he had signed with us in 2016.If you ignore the "no rings" noise Romo is a Hall of Famer. we just might and I'd like for you to film if possible?You jelly bruv?  We living our best lifeBud knight got rekt!Michelob ultraI see what you did thereüëàüòáWordDid you go to college in 1968 or something?Nah man, its 2019 we all leaf fans in the igloos.Roll tideDefinitely. I think Aikman would be in with no rings so Romo absolutely should be. 
r/nfl, NFL Blitz 2001 says great play. If I'm Sean Payton, win or lose, I'm getting fined todayWhat the fuck refs? How do you fuck that up?I despise the Saints but that‚Äôs one of the worst no calls I‚Äôve ever seenControversial? More like grand-theft no call.That‚Äôs the most blatant PI I‚Äôve ever seen Man that is an insane no call, how the hell do they miss that.Didnt play the ball, Helmet to helmet, defenseless receiver, Contact after 5yards. Pick ONE and this games over, pitiful officiating. That's not a controversial call, that's obvious penalty. That guy could have easily took that back for 6 if he didn't do that. Or he could have pulled a Lamarcus Joyner. Refs out there doing the birdbox challengeThe refs are going to need the national guard and maybe the coast guard to get out of New Orleans if the Saints lose If the Saints lose this game this crew should never call a playoff game again.OMG that was terrible1) Robey-Coleman does not play the ball   2) He utterly removes Lewis' ability to catch the ball   3) Helmet to helmet hit   4) Defenseless receiver   5) Clear line of sight to the play     The refs here were GUTLESS.  They were afraid of making a game ending call for a team, but in doing so, stole a reception and a play from the Saints inside the redzone.  This is the worst call of 2018.One of the worst no calls of all time. That is not an exaggeration.   What a fucking shitshow. That's bullshit.I'm gonna side with the saints here... And that's not supposed to happen How can you take this league seriously after that? Stuff like that just makes me want to quit watching the NFL all together. Honestly it makes me feel silly for ever caring. GET THE FUCK OUTTA HEREHorrific no callbecause of this, this offseason there's going to be rule changes like challenging PI calls or adding an upstairs official, because this is unacceptable  there have been a TON of just mind-bendingly awful calls/no-calls lately but this one came at the worst timeIt‚Äôs not controversial. That‚Äôs the an unjustifiable miscall. It‚Äôs egregious and the refs need to be investigated. Because they‚Äôre either blind, incompetent or best betting on the game.Worst no-call I've seen in a while. Holy shit.A whole family of Bucs fans and no one has shut up about how terrible that call was. That's how you fucking know it was bad. That or just having eyes.HORSE. FUCKING. SHIT. That's a HORRIBLE no call!Holy shit that wasn't even close to being debatable Refs just decided who's going to the superbowl. What the fuck when I come to power the refs will be the first to be executedNaniNeutral here. Calls like this makes the NFL look like pro wrestlingNfl trying hard to save LA market hmmm wonder whyNot enough (any) Rams flair in this thread speaking up.  I abso-fucking-lutely agree with everyone else.  This missed call was BS.  The game should be over and the Saints going to the Superbowl.  If the Rams do end up winning, this will (rightfully so) be a cloud over this game _and_ the Superbowl, _and_ next season if they win the SB.That‚Äôs PI and a personal foulI‚Äôm sick. That was ball game man. Worst no call of the season on the biggest stage yet.  I saw like 3 fouls holy shit. How was there not any flag at all?Excuse me what the fuckEven the CB comes up from that looking for the flagRef should be fired on the spotI'm usually all in favor of 'let them play' type football but that's as blatant as you can get.  You HAVE to call that.  Saints should be in the SB.How can people be so fucking terrible at there jobWhat the hellMan, it would have been great if Peyton just sent the team to the lockerroom and refused to come back out just to complete the backeye on the league for that missed call[deleted] Dude didn‚Äôt even attempt to get his head around. Brutal brutal no-call. Ended up costing them the game. Absolute bullshit no call"I've lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... Or ratings in not sure which. I won't be silent . Just saw it live sry."Maybe the guy who said it was rigged for the Rams wasn‚Äôt so crazy /s  But that was horrible. First of all it‚Äôs a PI. Second of all, it‚Äôs a helmet to helmet hit. Saints got robbedIncompetent officiating literally put wrong team in Super Bowl. How can you ever take NFL seriously again?This was definitely a terrible no call but what bothers me more is that LA‚Äôs right tackle has a false start on almost every passing play and has some pretty obvious holds that aren‚Äôt called. Noticed it when we played em and it‚Äôs happen all game today.This was not just PI, it was also a helmet to helmet hit and a clear as day one. That ref can forget the superbowl crew!!If Saints lose after that, there will be a flood of fans riotingThat was PI and A hit on a Defenseless ReceiverSaints got fucked"Controversial", lol.  You can just say "terrible", "egregious", "inexcusable", or "doubleplusungood".I feel bad for Saints fans.  I'm still *really* salty about the Seahawks vs Steelers superbowl game, and while there may have been more controversial calls, at least they were controversial.  This is not a controversial call. This is an officiating travesty that robbed the franchise of a Superbowl appearance.  Again just feel really bad for Saints fans. This will hurt for a long time, and towards the end of Brees's career too; it's just sad.unbelievable non-callBullshit callThe NFL is an absolute joke. The fact that they are instructing their Refs to be this inconsistent on purpose is going to end this league in 10 years because why the heck should we as fans spend a minute watching this shitshow?   If you don't know why the League wants noncalls and calls like what just cost the Saints a Superbowl chance it's all to do with money. The NFL will be spending billions in the next decade on lawsuits for CTE and other health affects from players and those settlements.   The more the NFL can claim that they had the rules but they just weren't followed correctly the easier it will be to lower those settlement payouts. People make mistakes all the time and refs are no different. So for every hit a Player's Lawyer brings to the lawsuit in causing irreplaceable damage to their client's life the League can counter with the exact same type of hit being called "correctly" in other examples. NFL lawyers are already compiling thousands of hits over the past 50 years to attack these lawsuits that can truly bankrupt the Nonprofit status of their owners. Can't have that.    What an absolute joke of an organization. Out of every single call and flag thrown for bullshit they just took a Superbowl chance and NFC Title away from the Saints. Not only does he hit him early, but he doesn‚Äôt attempt to make a play on the ball AND he hits him in the head. Fuck that shit. NFL games need to be officiated by that computer that won jeopardy.Just when you think you'll get a clean game, boom, refs.I thought that was close on the initial look but holy crap that was such an early hitWhat a complete fucking joke. These refs are absolute trash.I had sort of been pulling for the Rams. Anything other than a Saints victory would be a stain on the league at this point.#Blatant Helmet to helmet contact pass interference  NFL Refs   *Birdbox challenge*  Everyone watching  *shocked pikachu*Almost like the NFL wants their new LA experiment to work out. Not only is it clear PI but also should warrant ejection. I couldn't make my mind work for a few seconds after seeing it. Waiting for a flag to suddenly get thrown, but knowing it wasn't coming. Welp, this will be talked about for months now.Calls like this  Refs: *I sleep*  Touching the QB  Refs: **real shit??** 2nd big PI Robey-Coleman has gotten away with tonight. Horrific no callAre we still supposed to believe the NFL isn't rigged?  Of course the league wants the LA market to tune in to the Superbowl, the league's a jokeWhat a joke.That is a disgusting act by Bill VinovichMost horseshit noncall of all time Fuck the NFL. They know what they did. It wasn‚Äôt the first bad call. Bullshit. Fucking bullshit. Rigged as fuck. These NFL refs deserve everything coming to themWorst call of all time?This is horrible someone needs to be fired. Jesus. This shit is about to go down. When the rams win, we'll see the apocalypse in that stadiumWow, I missed it when it happened.  That is by far the worst no call I have ever seenI don't think I am going to watch the NFL anymore.Game is literally over right now if the call is correctSaints got robbed by the officials. Ball was uncatchable.         Because the receiver was steam rolled. Worst no call I‚Äôve seen in my entire life.Bill Simmons posted this about it... hilarious and gets it right.  https://www.facebook.com/1658537644412686/posts/2199998100266635?sfns=clThat was such a blatant miss, pisses me off and I don‚Äôt even care who wins That might be the most egregious no call I've ever seenThis is the worst call in the history of professional sports.I'm Canadian.   I stopped watching the NFL regularly a few years ago when I just couldn't deal with the refs ruining outcomes of games anymore. I watch the superbowl and that's about it.   Today, it's about -35C here so I decide to stay in and watch the games. I'm not necessarily a fan of either team, but admittedly it's hard not to like Brees and what he's accomplished.   What. In. The. Actual. Fuck.   The refs seemingly got worse. How is this possible? And not just the "no call" at the end. Seems like all game they're missing PI, holding, etc.   Fuck the refs. Fuck the NFL. I won't even bother following this league anymore. It's just too much. I can't even imagine how it must feel for NO players to have a trip to the superbowl ripped away from you because of some incompetent and/or corrupt refs. I can't even imagine...  Ok. I'm done with football. The NFL is a joke.That‚Äôs a no call of the horrible variety One of the worst calls I‚Äôve ever seen.  Simply astounding. Those refs should never be allowed near a football field again. that's an absolutely horrendous call. Really hoping that it doesn't end up affecting the outcomeLike seriously, that was the game right there. Refs gift wrapped the rams chance after chance.It's telling how long he spent looking around for the flag before he started celebrating.Gotta say, this no call is absolute horse shit. I was amazed it didn't get called. The Saints would have won and gone to the SB.  There has to be a rule change where a coach can challenge no calls!Refs singlehandedly gave the game to the rams. This was a monstrous fuck up.  If LA "wins" this will be a gigantic asterisk.Something needs to be done about officiating in this league. It's changed the outcome of several games this year. Thats not controversial at all. Its just wrong. There is no legitimate defense for that no call. Vinovich and his crew need to be barred from every calling a playoff game again.Game should be over. If the Rams 'win' this the NFL is going to lose whatever brand they have leftThis was terrible. Fuck the refs man. Super fucking rigged.Even as a Rams fan there is absolutely nothing I can say to justify this. I mean I should be happy we made it ... but some part of me thinks it¬¥s better to give it all and lose honest than winning through that shit :( *CONTROVERSIAL?*  There's no controversy, everyone agrees:  One of the biggest officiating fuck ups in the history of American sport. Everyone who pays attention to football, including the League, know the wrong team is playing in the SB this year. If ever there was a clear reason for a result of a game being over-turned (which will never happen), it was this.Bullshit to the max. All for big market LAIt‚Äôs rigged. Get the Rams to the Super Bowl after the move to generate more fan interest. Wow lolHoly shitImagine an uncalled penalty inside the two minute warning that's gonna get a five figure fine.That game was fucking stolen.Will this be what forces a rule allowing some kind of challenge or review of a penalty? Feels bad to see the game ripped from the Saints Fuck this league. I'm out.Jesus, even Anne Frank saw that. That was early as fuck, gotta call itCan‚Äôt beat the refsMight be the worst no call I‚Äôve ever seen. If the Rams win this game that call will be talked about for years. The amount of Vikings fans ITT supporting the Saints on this one tells you all you need to know.Vegas say OT, game fucking goes to OT.Given the circumstances, that‚Äôs one of the worst calls I‚Äôve ever seen. I blame Buffalo Wild Wingsmy heart hurts for saints fans because this is so badThat call actually makes me livid. I don‚Äôt like the Saints by any means, but them losing on a call like that puts a bad taste in my mouth.The problem is that the refs face no repercussions for thisAs a Falcons fan this pleases me!!!  As a football fan..... Fuck the refs!!!What's more upsetting is that Brees, a future first ballot hall if famer, gets screwed over like this. Games at any level or magnitude should ever be decided this way. There was two ref standing right there where the hit happened.  Mother of God. Game was completely fixed. It suits the NFL to have the team in the biggest market in the final. Rams had half empty stadiums last year remember. 23 knew he fouled him tooWhat a joke. Refs just pick who they want to winThat might be one of the worst no calls I‚Äôve ever seenWorst no call I have ever seen.Damn I hate the saints but that‚Äôs fucked upThats the worst no call i've EVER seen. Fucking bullshitIs it really even controversial? Clearly wrong.This rigged the game No big deal. Not like the game meant anything. Fucking terrible.So I went into this game wanting a Rams v. Patriots Superbowl.  Wanting the Rams to win it all.  Now I'm sitting here pulling for the Patriots to win it all.    My name's JJStryker and I'm pulling for the Patriots. shudders***Fire all the refs that were on the feild! Even that fucker in the white hat! Is there anyone i can write a letter to? I need an outlet for my fury rnSo that ref was betting on this game, right?Screw that "you cant lose a game on one call" mess, they lost on that no call.Between the no-call and Marcus Peters acting like a jack ass after the game, it‚Äôs becoming really hard to root for anyone but the AFC champ in the Super Bowl.DPI, defenseless receiver, targeting helmet. Pick one, player safety concerns my assWow.  Fuck those zebras.  Heads need to roll.Not enough linemen piling on 10 seconds after the playGoddamn, I loved that game so much.  NFL Blitz, NHL Hitz, and NBA Jam were just fun distilled into the goofiest and most entertaining form.*aww is that legal?*He's going postal!That autta' be illegal!Oooo now thats gotta hurt!!! MIDWAY PRESENTS NFL BLITZ 2000and1.  Dun dun du dududu dun dun du dududu.......etc.  Gonna be stuck in my head all night.Robey-Coleman hit him like he had been paid by Greg Williams.1st & 30You're no match for my powers. Hyuh  hyuhI'll be real disappointed if he doesn't. If I'm the Saints' owner I'm telling him to do it and I'll pay the fine. I am actively calling for the refs to never call a NFL game again in the post game presser, regardless of outcome. Fuck it, put it out there. ‚ÄúIf those guys ever ref a game again, you‚Äôll know they were instructed to keep the Rams in the game of possible.‚ÄùHe is perfectly justified in questioning the motivations of the officiating crew. And he should request an investigation. Officiating has been fixed before, it's not impossible or a conspiracy. If I was him I‚Äôd be very tempted to shove someoneStart bounty gate on the refsAll I say is "man being involved in this game for as long as I have, and seen as much football I have seen. There is no way I would trust this league enough to place a bet on it."   It wasn't even close. That was as blatant as it gets. "It's easy in slow motion"  That one was pretty easy in real time too MikeI love Robey-Coleman's reaction.  "Damn, I fucked up.  Wait, where's the flag?  Over here, nope.  Must be over here, nope.  No flag?  Hell yeah, get that weak shit outta here!"Maybe they're Steelers fans dishing out revenge for the Hayden call weeks ago? I dunno what else can explain that sort of blown call lmaoRiggedI have to agree. Holy shit what a fucking travesty.Heck I can't think of a more obvious PI that was *called*One of the biggest robberies ever if rams win now, it was literally game over at that exact moment if the flag is thrownAgreed. Controversy implies some people think it should have not been called.I'm having trouble finding a single argument you could make up as to why it's not.Shit, could have been targeting as wellYeah, there is absolutely nothing ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù about this. I‚Äôm honestly shocked that a DB at the pro level thought he could get away with that. Shows what I know, cause he fucking didThat was PI, targeting, helmet-to-helmet, hit on a defenseless receiver. Pick your choice, that was 15 yards in numerous different ways. This is some serious Tim Donaghy shit. On the bright side, now these type of plays will be reviewable. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it took a team getting robbed of a super bowl trip to make it happen. But that‚Äôs the way it works in the nfl. Ridiculous non call. Also he turns around and that‚Äôs a pickThat would have been pass interference in the 1970s thats how you know it's a shitty callEither the NFL is fixing games in LA's favor, or the refs are incomparably stupid. Neither situation is acceptable.[deleted]He did pretty much everything except hit him again after the play was over.It's controversial if it's not called isn't it?As is tradition in postseason games with less than 2 minutes to go in a 1-score gameThe only explanation tbhIt really is a shame they only make the NFL rulebook in braille Since both aren't getting paid rn best of luck actually getting security.>~~If the Saints lose this game~~ this crew should never call a ~~playoff~~ game again.Saints winning or losing shouldn't change the fact that it was a fireable no-call for the closest ref~~If the Saints lose this game~~ this crew should never call a playoff game again.[deleted]I'll cosign on that.They shouldn't call another game regardless of the outcome.2019*Looks like they might have stolen the entire game with that call too.It was the second bad no call PI this quarter.Bruh this is one of the worst calls of all-time.   Rams winning the game doesn't feel as good as it should because of this. When you consider that it's a conference championship game along with the the timing and consequences of the call, I can't think of a worse one off the top of my head. Cost us a trip to the Super Bowl   Fuck the refs, fuck this leaguewe need to make flags challengeable holy fucking shit I know you're probably just hedging your bets saying "one of" because you haven't seen them all, but I want anyone to show me a no call worse than this.    The defendant just murdered the victim in the courtroom, *in front of the judge,* and said judge ruled Not Guilty.If the Saints wind up losing, there's going to be a riot in the SuperdomeI honestly can‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs not a flag. You could have called a couple different penalties from that‚ÄúLet em play‚Äù my ass fucking blatant PIOne of the worst no calls I've seen this whole season.‚ÄúControversial‚Äù  As if anyone could disagree That's an understatementThat's beyond bullshit... Saints fans better be LIVID if they lose this one. Fucking disgraceful Probably the most obvious DPI I've seen this year.  No flag.  ???Clear as fuckin dayLol yeah this isn't controversial, it's clearly wrongYou went from +22 to +6 in a second Can‚Äôt get more clear than thatI know ... saying this is "controversial" means there's someone out there who's saying "no, that's perfectly legal."    I really don't think anyone could say that with a straight face.  There‚Äôs no siding with the saints there‚Äôs just siding with being able to fucking seeThat was a Vikings level missed call... what a fucking joke! Is it ok to realize that it‚Äôs a bad no-call but not feel bad about it? Asking for an NFC North fan base. Saints got absolutely jobbed.   To be honest I‚Äôm actually happy on account of my deep-seated need for petty revenge for ‚Äò09.  But yeah that‚Äôs fucked up and needs to be fixed. Really not fair to that team.Yeah what the hell. Robbery in broad daylight.Ref could be a bitter Viking fan mad about 09‚Äô. Only explanation IMO.  Well, they still have a lot of negative karma calls to clear up for trying to kill Brett FavreThinking the same shit. Your team has no chance if the refs will not call an easy penalty or call a questionable penalty.  NFL games are impacted way too much on the refs. More than any other damn sport One of the worst I think I've ever seenI hope you are right.  What sucks is we won‚Äôt here anything official from the NFL about this blatant miss call for weeks Edit:  I guess I was wrong. The NFL already admitted it was a miss call for PI and helmet to helmet contactYeah, there have been multiple Pass Interferences either missed or called when there wasn‚Äôt even contact.Just make everything challengeableThat‚Äôs gotta be the worst no call ever... in like any sport And it singlehandedly decided the game.Would have been happy to see the saints get blown out, but this was bullshit.They needed to lose, but like, legit, not this kinda bullshitHow do NFL level refs miss that what the fuckAn absolutely atrocious call that will go down in infamy if the Saints lose.So fucking blatantBeyond textbookRefs receive their orders from the league office.omae wa mou shindeiru I was thinking NBA Now do they side with NE or LA?I don‚Äôt think I buy that the NFL colluded to get LA to the Super Bowl but I honestly don‚Äôt blame anyone for believing it. That was a historically awful no-call and couldn‚Äôt have been more convenient for the NFL as a whole.Yeah I 100% believe they no called it to let the Rams get the ball back and make it "A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!" that's some BS lol.Thank you for your objectivity. I fucking hate the Saints, big time. They won the game and should be heading to the Superbowl. I feel like shit over this, and my teams not even involved.I do feel bad for you guys (Rams fans) Not your fault, you all likely agree this was a horrible call, and you‚Äôre gonna get shit on. Sorry man. I'm sorry. you're right. Every ref in this game should be immediately fired.There has to be 3-4 officials watching that and not one throws yellow. Weak kneed milk drinkers.I‚Äôd love to see that. I also want to see him fight the ref after the gameAs a Seahawks fan, I'm disappointed to have other teams share in our premium ref controversy experience.I mean, you‚Äôre right on the first two parts and ‚Äútainted‚Äù is maybe justifiable depending on what that means to you. It wasn‚Äôt undeserved, though. You guys made plays after when it counted. The refs fucked us out of a situation where we almost certainly win and go to the Super Bowl. The Rams beat us in overtime.  Enjoy your Super Bowl, bro. Ours was one of the greatest moments of my life and especially a sports fan having grown up in Louisiana in a sea of Cowboys fans and people shitting on a horrible Saints team. Bountygate, rule changes, and questionable calls all ‚Äútaint‚Äù that shit in some eyes, but at the end of the day, we won a Super Bowl fair and square regardless of what happened before.  You guys didn‚Äôt do shit except for take the opportunity you were given.I'd argue it will actually be forgotten by next year, which hurts worse for Saints fans. That's how all of these terrible calls end up.   Still an undeniably horrible no-callYou can‚Äôt man. This hurts so much. We don‚Äôt have Drew much longerI‚Äôm not watching the Super Bowl this year. If the Patriots beat the Chiefs, I won‚Äôt even check ESPN for the score.The cynic in me says it's going to be a Rams Patriots Super Bowl.     Two teams most fans are basically going to hate now. Enjoy your shitty ratings NFL.I've noticed more and more tackles in general starting a beat early with no calls. It's never been like that before.OKAY I'M NOT CRAZY, THANK GOD.  I WAS SO CONFUSED ALL GAME  no one i was watching with was noticing ite itherAny fan of the NFL should be pissed. I remember why I stopped watching football a few years ago. The NFL is fucking pathetic.And a hit to the head. Christ.Goddamn it I‚Äôm in agreement with falcons fans.   But in al seriousness, if a falcons fan will come out in public and protest a bullshit call in a Saints game that is fucking saying something. Seriously. I wanted a Rams vs Chiefs SB, but not by them just getting robbed.If they could've influenced the Chargers game they probably would've, too. Just how they painted St. Louis as a city that couldn‚Äôt support the rams to move the team despite the city bending over backwards to give the team everything it needed.**no call, but yesagreed dude, i dont even want to watch the afc game nowHE CAN'T DO THAT!HURGHI'LL SEND YOU BACK TO YOUR MOTHER IN A BOXSometimes you could get chokeslam and powerbomb animations if you spammed enough late hits.Don't forget MLB Slugfest!Hey you cant do that?!I will make it legal The Saints lifelong owner just passed away sadly, I believe his wife is in control now, which is hopefully accurate, his children and grandchildren were written out of the team/will ownership wise because they were brats Fuck it, pull a Longest Yard. Teach them.I try to stay rational about these things. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take. Not just with the Saints, obviously, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where my enjoyment of every NFL game is severely diminished. I probably will keep watching but I‚Äôve never been this close to quitting. Something needs to be done, but unfortunately this sport is just too popular. And we know what matters most in this country. Money. Sorry for rant. I‚Äôll get over it, maybe. Go the whole 9 yards and challenge them to a fight during the presser. New Super Bowl halftime show.Well, it's not on the ENTIRE crew.  That's not fair. It's solely on the backjudge.   I don't want the head ref making that call....he's got his own responsibilities.I really hope he does say something iirc, the Rams were 0-8 when Vinovich and crew were the officiating team.   1-8 now.It‚Äôs even worse when they admit that they fucked up days later. Pivotal plays in the playoffs *have to* be made reviewable. It would‚Äôve taken two seconds for them to see it was interference had they been allowed to look at it.  You commit that shit in more subtle ways. Cumulative bites out of the apple. Little things. You don‚Äôt just blow it up. That had to be incompetence in the First Degree because the whole point of a conspiracy is that no one finds out. Well if it's a secret plan concocted by a small group of people, that's a conspiracy.Honestly, I can‚Äôt fathom how this isn‚Äôt fixed officiating. That call was so bad I can‚Äôt even think of a hyperbole to compare it to. It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre all salty and you say something like ‚Äújeez you might as well just let the defender tackle the receiver before the ball gets there.‚Äù Except that‚Äôs literally what happened. I find it really difficult that anyone who has experience calling an nfl game could just like... miss that. How has officiating been fixed before?  (Serious question, would like to read about it.)Lmao. That's terrible but for some reason I'm also amused by the idea of players going out of their way to "accidentally" land on the refs. Or a giant RB just trucking through like he's on the defense.  This also makes me wonder what happens if a ref gets injured. Is there a backup? How many? 1. Early contact. 2. Catchable ball. 3. Defender clearly wasn't making an attempt on the ball.  Pretty much textbook PI call.You didn't even have to see the hit to know it was early because you could hear the helmets collide!He literally said that right after lol.  ‚ÄúBut with this one, it was pretty obvious in real time as well‚ÄùThat was his point in the second half of that sentence where he said "but there was enough time there to see that"hmm if it's easy in slow motion maybe we should let coaches challenge no calls I was like... any second now we'll see a flag and there was nothing.Steelers fan here. That call is bullcrap[deleted]If we manage to win, r/NFL might even root for the Pats over us If Roby was going for the ball low and actually had an eye/hand towards (what I thought had happened at play speed when there was no flag) it but that's not what actually happened.Mike Pereira said the same on the broadcast.I think even the rams player was quiet after that one. But once he realized there was no call, all the rams players cheered hard and congratulated him. I agree, but targeting doesn‚Äôt exist in the NFL. They never call uncatchable unless it's out of bounds or misses by like 10 yards. The pass was probably not going to be caught, but it was in the field of play and only missed by a few yards.Controversial to me means debatable like Dez Bryant's catch/drop vs. Packers.   I don't believe you can debate otherwise in this one. It is just a missed call. The other explanation is that we finally found where Stan Kroenke put Arsenal's missing transfer budgetThe national guard are.  They're state government.EVER. I don't see how you don't at least get knocked back down to like, college games or something even if you're a professional referee.   I mean that dude basically picked the NFC superbowl representative. They should never call a beer league game.Good eye . . . unlike the refs.No. The whole season. And that‚Äôs saying something. This years officiating crew has had some epic garbage calls/misses.   I mean, just epic. Both!I like it when the refs let them play.  I hate ticky tack calls in crunch time, but this no call almost positively cost the Saints the game.There is always big Ben sitting on his ass after getting hit and putting the ball in the endzone for a TD in the Superbowl for me.Sorry dude. I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs really going to disagree with you. The wrong team won today. Understandable since that calls literally the game Security will have to do there best or those refs won't make it out of there alive They should fucking burn it down.  That's the second huge, obvious no-call on 3rd down the refs have missed this game.  Sick.All hell would break loose. I bet the NFL desperately wants an LA team to make it to the Super Bowl Justifiably so[deleted]Oh dear god they won.The no call is obviously bullshit. But the fact that all the defender needed to do was look at the ball and he had an easy TD return is even worse. Jesus, what a monumentally stupid play that got bailed by the refs. Riot. Now.Literally everybody except the refs can see that apparently. Defenseless receiver, DPI, or Helmet to helmet. your pickWe should all know that's code for "the refs are blinder than Stevie Wonder"One of the worst no calls in the history of the league if you consider the circumstances. And I‚Äôm a neutral fan.PI and helmet to helmet hit. I want the saints to hold this L but yeah that's def a PINah I'm sure they're fine about it yeah i'm dead inside. Stevie Wonder in shambles. Driving around town hitting everyone in sight. I will be astonished if the ref who missed that call isn't fired. Inexcusable. I can't even imagine what losing the NFC Championship game in New Orleans by a FG in OT on the backs of a critical INT and a questionable PI call would feel like.  Edit: Refs also missed a facemask on Goff that would have given the Rams 2 more plays from like the 2.I don‚Äôt feel bad at all, I‚Äôm still salty about 2009. But after this game and last years playoff game against them I don‚Äôt feel salty at all anymoreYaI'm mad about shitty officiating.  I like a well-run league; so as a football fan I'm unhappy.  As a Viking fan?  I'm neither really happy nor sad.  I am slightly happy though that next time Saints fans call us salty sore losers for what happened in 09 I can bring this up and ask them if they still think officiating has no affect on the outcome of a game.  Maybe now Saints fans will be a little less shitty now that they know what it feels like to be robbed of a NFC title due to poor officiating.I mean how is the spot of the ball reviewable, but not that? That call was the MOST important call of the game and most obvious. The fact that they can't take a second look on that call is so ridiculous, I've never understood that.I seriously have no idea on any given pass play whether or not a PI will called at this point. I just hold my breath for a few seconds waiting to see if there'll be a late flag after every incompletion.Lmao on one of the replays the ref on the other side of the field was just staring slack-jawed at the hitScared FThis would be two heartbreaking, albeit for different reasons, loses in consecutive years."You expected competent refs, but it was me, Dio!"   \- That ref probablyRefs are a bunch of bakas. This was like watching James Harden officiated gamesLA, get Brady to come back for one more year for another shot No. They want LA to go to Superbowl to justify themWe all feel like shit because the game we love is fucked. Is it corruption, incompetence or malice, who knows, but can‚Äôt really feel good about a game getting fucked like that. I wanted to go to the Super Bowl very bad. But now it feels dirty. No matter what happens, the outcome's tainted.There needs to be an investigation. This was too bad for me to believe it was incompetence. The fix was in on this one. Don‚Äôt you dare fucking insult milk. I mean apparently you can his throw your whole body at someone‚Äôs head and it not be an issue. Brady Snow vs Oakland  Fumble.   History never dies.  The nfl will bury it. No announcer will ever be allowed to mention it. I‚Äôve literally never felt worseThey would have had to somehow convince the Chargers they werent playing in a playoff game. BROTHERThat's why I hate the Rams. Left for a bigger market like scumsExactly what MLS just tried to do to the Crew. Anthony Precourt became the investor/operator of the team, did everything he could to dissuade people from coming, and tried to use that to say that he needed to move. Thankfully, the people of Columbus called him out on his bullshit and they still have the team, but Anthony Precourt was unfortunately gifted a team in Austin.That was an illegal hit, but a lot of fun to watch.SHOOT HIM OR SOMETHING!VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, BUT A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH!!I‚ÄôLL ALLOW ITHURG HURGyou're no match for my powers!"MLB Baseball. Major League MLB"  "That's dumpster sludge, Tim."  God I loved that gameCan we add nba street and nfl street to this list. Not same but man I miss those times. If true that is amazingly awesome. Always gotta protect your McNuggetsExcuse me for being stupid but what does pull a longest yard mean?the NFL needs to implement a penalty review system. Its 2019, we got high definition cameras all over the field and dont need to rely solely on the eyes of the refs anymore. You're 100% right. This season started with "QBs make us money so you're not allowed to tackle them anymore", which was bad enough. We've come all the way to "Overtime gets better ratings so fuck the rules" in just one season. It's disgusting. The goddamn roughing the passer penalty in the New England game confused the shit out of me. I haven't watched much football this year but when did hitting the QBs (non-throwing) shoulder constitute a penalty? It's all bullshit.Seems it was on at least 2 of them. The announcers said they were talking.The head ref can override his teams calls.   When the penalty is that blatant he should override and call it I see your point, but it's not only the backjudge's eyes who are on Robey-Coleman at that point in the play.  EDIT: Since a couple of people have tried to tell me I'm wrong, [here's field-side footage that shows three refs watching, with two right on top of the play](https://twitter.com/brain262ricky/status/1087195677086621696).was it the same ref that blew the helmet to helmet no call in the first?They should ***at least*** let non-calls be reviewable like a challenge. Like seriously. It would pretty much silence the fans saying the games are rigged.I feel like conspiracy theorists have led to a poor connotation for the word. People assume it has to be something entirely outlandish like the faked moon landing or flat earth.Plus helmet to helmetI would almost prefer the NFL says it was fixed than believe they fielded a crew this incompetent.Its probably not fixed because its fucking obvious as hell and is going to be on the news for a week.   This is a sport where there is holding on every play. Fixing a game would be soooo easy to slide in there.  Its almost unfathomable that they saved up their grand plan to secure the Rams victory by not calling holding or any of those delay of game calls on the saints and at the last moment were like "YES THIS HELMET TO HELMET PI IS MY MOMENT TO SNEAK IT IN!"  In the NFL or in general? Tim Donaghy in the NBA was convicted of using his power as a ref to shave points so he would win bets. Refs have gotten injured so badly before that they couldn't continue. There is no backup official, but they have a 6-man officiating system.Don't forget helmet to helmet. Honestly could've been a personal foul too The refs even discussed it afterward according to the announcers!Bonus helmet to helmet which is supposed to get you banned from the league or whatever now.Helmet to helmet tooI was saying the same thing so I guess I didn't hear him. That was an awful miss. It makes me even angrier about the Haden thing tbh. Haden being adjacent to the receiver = penalty, this = nothing. What the fuck.Rams only had 1 timeout, there would've been no time after the field goal.It literally cost the Saints the game  We win (assuming lutz makes the 28 yarder as time expires) they could've taken 120 secs away.  this was game overDon't get ahead of yourself. If the Rams play the Patriots, the Rams would be the 3rd most hated team on the field. Behind the Pats and the Refs. Easy there, tiger. One day public opinion will turn on this team, but not against the Patriots. I don‚Äôt fault the Rams. No matter the outcome, I certainly won‚Äôt *hate* the Rams for it.You have a good excuse for seeing it differently at full speed, from a distant camera. The official is standing 5 yards away, looking at the players, and can presumably hear the collision of the helmets. Should have been called. I hope that play convinces the NFL that the HQ officials should be able to throw a flag for personal fouls.Oh yeah you could see him looking for the flag.Then it's PIFrom every angle they showed it could have been caught if he wasn‚Äôt hitYes and the debate is the refs call vs the rest of what the football world sawI‚Äôll upvote a cross-sports jokefucking hell, nowhere is safeN E T S P E N D  E  T  S  P  E  N  DHoly shit it all makes sense.Had arsenal win today too for the misdirectionAs not only an Arsenal fan but just a fan of sports in general this man is a fucking disgracePlease stop, i'm already dead inside.Moh in shamblesprobably also saints fans, so they might suddenly go blind like the refs did during the game when angry fans come up.They probably won‚Äôt.  The NFL fires a big percentage of the refs every year.Ok, this is epicAs a Browns fan, I got to hear a ref say it was ok for Baker Mayfield to take a headshot mid slide and watch Russell Okung take 2 steps, set his feet, eat a sandwich, and call his mother before the snap without a flag...Two of my friends think it was a good no call. I am now convinced they ate crayons and glue as children. I really wanted the Saints to lose, but not like this. This is just shit reffing, and casts doubt over the Superbowl and maybe even next season. Imagine the amount of salt that will happen if the Rams win the SB.On the bright side we get OT, buffalo wild wings definitely paying that ref for the no callthey should hope security is better at their job than themselves (and no hardcore saints fans)The fact that it‚Äôs the second time it‚Äôs happened this game is what makes it so bad. After that first one, you oughta to be zoned in on what‚Äôs going on, and to shit the bed on an even more obvious call is just disgraceful.I have no real rooting interest in the game besides a general appreciation for the Saints and the BS league stuff they endured and man...I'm apeshit and it wasn't even my team playing.Absolutely, best way to get them more popularity in a such a market. They are creaming their pants at the idea of LA in the Superbowl.Which is kind of ironic, seeing as the big "conspiracy" this year I kept hearing was "oh man the refs are pulling for the Saints so Brees can get one last ring" but that shit just got thrown right out the window.And then him celebrating with his teammates after like he made a really good play was just extra insulting. These refs sponsored by Bird BoxThat's the worst part. Even if you miss the timing, it's still a penalty for the hit. Holy shitI don‚Äôt think they were blind, just willfully ignorant. Don‚Äôt have the balls to make a call that could / would decide the game.Two penalties so it‚Äôs double jeopardy so it‚Äôs fine, no penalty  -Bill ‚ÄúMichael Scott‚Äù Vinovichcorrect... also pretty bad because if #23 turns his head around and finds the ball it could have been a pick-6Yeah I fucking hate the Saints but that was a terrible no-call.[deleted]Texting (thru Braille) for nfl operation‚Äôs location‚ÄúIn sight‚Äù. You‚Äôre wrong for that.The NFL's fired one ref ever. And I bet the league's happy with overtime ratings anyways. *Roger Goodell has left the chat*"MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!"  -Ref to PaytonI don't think there is any other explanation, but it's commonplace for the league. The shittiest thing is the ‚Äúhype‚Äù trailer after taking about how the Rams high power offense ‚Äúrolled‚Äù over us Otw to the Super Bowl..... sigh. Totally uncalled for, but a lot of fun to watch!HEADSET, HEADSET, HEADSETI can hear these in my head and it is killing meHUA HUA HUA!its true. Our owner is a sweetheart too.Very true. Rumor is that Sean Payton has a clause in his contract that if Rita Benson (one of Benson's kids) ever took over the team and he had to report to her (instead of Mickey Loomis) he would be allowed to opt out of his contract because of how shitty his kids were.Throw the ball hard as possible at the refs nutshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1_B8zX87wNot only was it obvious...obvious might not be strong enough word, but if watch in slow mo, there was also helmet to helmet!!!Not a *frequent* watcher here, but I actually tend to turn it off any time a game goes to overtime. It's a garbage, lopsided process that hugely favors whoever wins the coin toss. RNG with that much weight has no place in a competitive game. Awful, awful game design.These shouldn't require a challenge, a couple refs watching the live feeds in a booth could spot them easier than a coach on the sidelines.  A couple refs watching all the live HD video feeds would probably catch most issues, and eliminate most challenges.  I'd still leave the challenge system in place, but if a couple booth refs watching HD feeds could ensure calls were correct, coaches wouldn't risk time outs on challenges as often.So you're saying if the Saints got screwed then the Earth is flat? GotchaThere were two other blatant helmet to helmet plays targeting Kamera. Oh yeah, that's my favorite part about this. They missed at least ***two*** penalties on the same play.He would‚Äôve been ejected in a college game. Yea those 2 refs did discuss it. Somehow neither of them saw it.Apparently it‚Äôs punishable by being sent to the Superbowl scot freeOh yeah for sureAs long FG was made of course.  But yea 99% game over.I'm assuming that refs are second on that list...Yeah I'd love to see challengeable calls/no-calls as well.I'M TIRED ROBBIE "We did not see and were not aware of the 20,000 person angry mob."Are they Rams fans? I don‚Äôt see how anyone unbiased says that‚Äôs a good no call. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre winging it!‚Äù  -Sponsored by the Referees of the NFLAnd Goodell so he gets an LA team in the Superbowl!i literally cant imagine how id feel if i were a saints fan...that is beyond bullshitthe most pass interference call in the history of pass interference not get called pass interference.Not making the call decides the game just as muchThat's...that's not how jepordy works...If the saints lose this is on an all time low lights list for the league foreverTHRU BRAILLE LMFAOLmaoThe nfl has only fired one ref in season. They let them go during offseason before. Whether it's by the choice of the nfl or the referee to leave, we don't know as they don't release the names. But you can compare yearly lists and see who is gone. Lmao thanksI want this. I want this bad. No, if the refs were paid by the NFL that game, the moon is flat.That's the most egregious part of the no call. Textbook PI and personal foul all wrapped up into one tight package.What about defenseless receiver? Isn't that a third?Hell, this might have been a penalty even in the 1975 NFL.Were you watching?  Nah, you?  Nope... Bourbon st after the game?  Sure!‚ÄúYo, my contact fell out, did you see what happened?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI had an eyelash in my eye.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFuuuuuck.‚ÄùWhat's worse is that you can see the ref in the replay looking right at them.I tried to do enough gymnastics to justify it because I wanted the Rams to win but I can‚Äôt do it.You might have missed my ninja edit, yeah Pats, then Refs, then Rams. That or have them be able to reverse the outcome based off what was shown, time, situation, etc. This play alone is the end of the game, but no, the refs go and gift the game to the Rams.You can‚Äôt even defend this as a Rams fan. Talk about a bittersweet win. I‚Äôve waiting for this team to get back into the chip since 02 and for it to happen like this.......   We the baddies now. Accurate.Chargers are gonna have like 2 fans left if the Rams win the superbowl.If you haven't seen that movie, you should lol.Of course the moon is flat it's a pizza pie. "two fouls offset"  lmaoIf I was them I wouldn't dareLol they may not want to go there.  I just walked down it and I've never seen that street so quiet. It was spooky.Being #1 seed means nothing vs the all mighty power of the blind refs. Fucking end meI wonder if they paid that random Rams fan in the crowd to cry after the game lmaoWhy would they gain a fan from this?Psh get a load of this guy. What a dumbass. We've known for decades now that the moon is a giant wheel of cheese.Yeahhh probably should get to the airport ASAP. I‚Äôd go straight to the airport not even back to the hotelOh you bastardGives Rivers time to have another child.

Landry was pushing hard to get him in Miami when he was still down here. For those not aware OBJ and Landry played together in college.> Landry  Dude has to be over the moon. He's only relevant with a proper #1 opposite him. Mayfield is gonna have Landry freed up 10x more than last season.I love this for Landry.  I‚Äôm gonna draft him again like an idiot. Steelers lost AB and Bell. Defense sucks and team is clearly declining.  Ravens have an anemic pass offense and got "figured out" in the playoffs. Jackson will need to take a HUGE step forward to keep the offense from being shit. The defense is still good but losing a bunch of key figures like Weddle and Suggs. I expect some mild regression there.  The Bengals are dogshit.  The Browns now have Baker Mayfield, Nick Chubb, (Kareem Hunt kinda), OBJ, Landry, Higgins, Njoku, and a decent O line. I think it's likely they have a top 8 offense minimum with Kitchens as HC. Their defense has Myles finally getting another decent edge rusher to support him, a fantastic stud CB, and a host of other nice pieces on defense. I expect their defense to be in the top 11-19 range, and that should be plenty for the AFC North crown.  If they don't make the playoffs in the next 2 years I'm gonna be so upset for them. The AFC North has never been this bad. The Browns have never been this good.I imagine step 4 is trade up to #2 to take a QB2020 first overall pick is gonna be used to draft a NT. They're waiting til 2021 for Eli to ride off into the sunset in the ultimate #TANK4TREVOR Gotta go all out for that Tua '20 or Trevor '21 sweepstakesBrowns will make the superbowl before Bell decidesBaker.

Continuously denying the massive amounts of smoke being leaked out.And I thought we were having a bad day."It's not happening STFU"Lmao they were SO sure he wasn‚Äôt gonna get traded  OBJ is playing backup QB broBut for real though, what a receiving corps between OBJ, Landry, Njoku and the rest Kareem Hunt too if he qualifies to play this year And Kareem Hunt. This sucks because the Browns were always my go to team. I would make a franchise player and lead the crappy Browns to a super bowl victory against all expectations and become mayor of Cleveland.Ohhh ohh do the defense too!They're all so young too...~~RB - Duke Johnson~~ RB - Kareem HuntWell Baker‚Äôs gonna light it up huhI swear to God there was an argument between a Giants fan and a Texans fan in this sub today, and the Texans fan said "just wait until Odell gets traded to the Browns" and the Giants fan replied "Yeah they said that last year too".

Hell yeah.That song inspired my nameKILL MEEEEEEEEEEI am fully expecting to go 19-0 and win every game by 50. I don't think I'm getting too far ahead of myself here. I had Browns as my dark horse playoff team last season. Now, winning the division doesn‚Äôt seem that much of a stretch. I honestly feel sorry for the guy at this point. The place is dumpster fire, he's the only weapon they have so defenses will throw everything at him and he's got that rookie contract for a while so he's not even getting paid what he probably should be (considering how much he means to that offense). I won't be surprised when in 5 years time his body is just broken completely.NFCE fans rejoice ‚ÄúIs OBJ available?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay good talk‚Äù   -A comment I made like 4 hours ago   JESUS WHAT THE FUCKStill going to show that damn highlight on SNF every time they or Dallas plays.

Giants and AFCN in shamblesUbering around downtown Manhattan Between this and desean THE RETURN, Giants fans about to be counting the days till pitchers catchers 2020Same deal as the Mack trade. There were signs and smoke it was going to happen but fans ignored it. Lol they seriously made a luxury pick on an RB like they were one pick away from being Super Bowl contenders just to start a rebuild the next year and trade away a top 5 WR.   I will be basking in Giants schadenfreude when they eventually trade Saquon away too for peanuts1500 yards rushing and receiving each for Saquon. Giants still finish 2-14There was so much smoke, they just chose to ignore it. Same as the Mack trade.

I‚Äôm kinda scared for Saquon, he has 0 help and is going to be getting crushed. Even if he stays healthy, he‚Äôll never really have a chance to shine with the Giants as they are, and his career could really suffer. After seeing his potential last season I really hope he either gets some major help or makes it somewhere that suits him. Drafted him 1.10 in my fantasy draft and I‚Äôve loved the kid since day 1 haha.Dude did NOT skip leg dayYou didn't pay attention to the Adrian Peterson/Christian Ponder era of the Vikings I see...He‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still a giants fanHoly shit it's gonna happen...We technically already have still. 1994 for us vs 1990 for BengalsSTOP MAKING ME PARANOIDIf the Bears can‚Äôt win, I‚Äôll accept this resultCan I come?Suicide pact anyone? Brown is older. Obj is prime. I mean every other AFCN team has gotten worse (Cincy wtf are you doing) and Cleveland has signed the second best RB available and traded for arguably the best WR. Fuck it me too. That offense is loaded and they added a couple of nice pieces to their D-line TAKEN MY ARMS  TAKEN MY LEGS  TAKEN MY SOUL  LEFT ME WITH LIFE IN HELLThe Lord says write the vision and make it plain.Ok follow me here  Jets trade our pick for saquon and their later round pick.   Nicest guy too, he'll just say "thanks for letting me play with you guys"My wife is a Redskins fans and is so happy. I‚Äôm totally getting my dick sucked.Bruh we just got rid of ABname him DorseyBaker and Dorsey hangin‚Äô dong on everybodyI was already rooting for the Browns with how they played last season with Baker, now I'm even more amped for them. Can't wait to see Juice and OBJ lighting it up together again. Dude I'd high five you as a fellow NFCE fan. This is hilarious.  (Then I'd wash my hand)One of us! One of us!*We didn't sign him just to trade him!*And a year ago they only had njoku holy shitPerriman even :(And Callaway tooIn case you hadn‚Äôt seen, it was for a 1st, 3rd, and Jabrill peppershttps://twitter.com/Kat_Terrell/status/1105618768544305154?s=20Hue was trying to contain them. He wasn't holding the Browns back, he was letting the rest of the NFL live normal, peaceful lives.Hey, I didn‚Äôt expect Mahomes to be a top 3 QB this season. Sometimes shit just happens.The Browns usurping the Mahomes dynasty before it can even begin would be SO Chiefs. We can take turnsBaker about to ball the fuck out.  We were dreaming about what his production would have been with Josh Gordon over at /r/fantasyfootball   Next best thingr/NFL has hotter stoves than r/baseball but straighter takes than r/NBAThe Browns may just own the AFC North.    Who knows with that offense (Baker, Jarvis, ODB, Njoku, Chubb) and that defense, they might represent the AFC outright. Unless it's Nick O'Leary. The it designates someone who plays without gloves and who is the grandson of famous golfer Jack Nicklaus.Then why is Nick Foles a QB?Did you know Ryan Fitzpatrick went to Harvard?And we still don't know what Callaway will turn into. He is a first round talent for sure. why tf am I crying so loud?Giants GM would not win a Dundie Award. W O R K SNo, they're allowed to fire him from whatever unrelated job he has at the time.You act like he‚Äôs not going to somehow come backParkey tried to kick the towel back but it hit the doorframe ‚ÄúThey fucking boomed us‚Äù  -Giants fans for the foreseeable futureTell that to Jarvis[Spears] Jarvis Landry yelled, "There you go!" David Njoku gave a look of pleasant surprise. Nick Chubb belted, "We got a fucking squad now." and before Baker Mayfield hit the locker room, ex-NFL star Joe Thomas hugged him & said, "Y'all look so different." Begging (thru texts) for the date of the next boat trip.It‚Äôs been covered up by the tire fire in Pittsburgh Never more. we have removedditWHO DELETES PROPHECY!Remindme 4 hours  Call a doctor for an erection lasting more than 4 hoursIt was so odd, there was smoke for days, then it got snuffed completely yesterday and blew up today.r/nfl just got 720 no-scoped For real, they fuckin boomed meIt's not out of the blue at all. It's been talked about for months. Specifically to the Browns has been at least a couple of weeks now. This sub just decided that droves of reporters were making shit up. x4 Orchard Park Bills are the only NY team.He meant the Browns. Congratulations, your team has been selected!So you guys can win *another* playoff before they win one. I'm not seeing an issue here. [deleted]As a Bears fan from Ohio I second thisAlso OBJ isn't out talking nonsense, throwing furniture around, skipping games and dyeing his mustache gold.Don't forget Olivier Vernon and Sheldon Richardson TAKEN MY OOOOO BEEEE JAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY-epic solo-Giants can't lose all their games if they don't have any players. My cousin went to Penn State and he met him a couple years back at a bar. He was at the bar by himself just minding his own business and watching TV. My cousin went up to him and introduced himself and said he was a big fan. Barkley thanked him, shook his hand and just went to minding his own business. Crazy to think someone so young with so much talent is so humble. Congrats on the dick suckingWe got you famHell yeah brother, cheers from Iraq2 years ago they were fucking 0-16. This is the greatest rebuild of all time Don‚Äôt you forget about my Johnson. You never know when he‚Äôll pop up. Perriman being opposite is scary.... even with his drops issues he used to have teams would need to account for his speed.. now that he can seemingly catch again who do you cover? Double obj and single perriman? He will burn almost any corner in the league. Drop 7 rush 4? Well hunt/chubb/Johnson will run it down your throat.   Landry will beat any zone with his hands and route running. Njoku is a mismatch from hell. I dont see the weakness on this offense.   I might need to go see a doctor in 4 hoursThat's a lot more than the Steelers got for ~~AB~~ Mr Big Chest. Wow. New spin: Hue wasn't hiding the Browns from the world, Hue was hiding the world from the BrownsBut please win the division and knock the Steelers off their perch and make them suffer like you had to suffer.r/NFL is straighter than r/NBA in the same way a football is straighter than a basketball. It hints at straightness but we all know it isn't reallyGuess you can totally revamp a team in 2 short years.   Salute Dorsey.Dick size wouldn‚Äôt let him be a TEAdam Thielen played soccer with Clayton Kershaw in middle school.Maybe now we'll learn to estimate him. or just straight out of a cannon. I hate so much about the things you choose to beThe fuck man. Clay Matthews has been flagged for roughing the towel"They're so good."  -Whole league Pasta full circle back to CLE in a year, amazingCongrats on your Superbowl Appearance.  I am on the Browns hype train WE HAVE TECHNOLOGYI was sure that was BS! What the f*ck just happenedThere was one Colts fan in particular who said it made the Browns FO look really dumb when that misleading article came out that the Giants laughed at our pitch for OBJ.    Hey, particular Colts fan, fuck you.OP Bills comin atcha Well yeah orchard park is in New York Let's just become the Golden State Warriors of the NFL.  Stack that shit with every talented young-but-developed player in the league.  I feel that makes it even more insulting....we can leave, come back and suck for 20 years and still win one before they do...###SAY IT LOUDER THE BROWNS ARE HERE TOO ACTUALLY COMPETEyeah big difference is the steelers HAD to trade brown. giants didnt have to do shit. Acting like Mr. Big Cheeks isn't a fashion pioneer.  Typical yinzer.  edit: also, glad the whole AFC North can shit on AB now.\*shreds guitar Kirk-style\*God damn it, in all of this turmoil of being a Giants fan rn, this made me laugh, I wish i could guild youStraight up James' rhythm guitar under the solo is more impressive than the solo. Possibly my all time favorite riff.*snare drum emulating machine gun**taps temple*Congrats on the blunt too sirI‚Äôm going to cum because of Gettleman‚Äôs stupidity. And into the lake?!Why are you the way that you are?*repeats 4 times*Oh shit! I am so used to seeing the pasta I fucking forgot it was Cleveland this was originally about lmaoTime is as flat as Kyries perception of Earth. I'm ready to watch the Steelers get shellacked. *computer smashing noises*>What the f*ck just happened   -Giants fans for the forseeable future David Gettleman got pissed over something and burned a star receiver... Been there, done that.Well fuck, Giants had to do *something* this off-season I guess. Other than the obvious #1 priority in resigning DeOssie.James has the best right hand in the business and I‚Äôm not really a big fan of Metallica. Dude is just so solid at playing rhythm.People underestimate how much the backing stuff impacts the solo. Not to say writing and playing a good solo isn‚Äôt really hard though.Is that song a reference to the book Johnny Got His Gun? That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm ever seen the lyrics written out. We‚Äôre all in great moods. Life is good.That's a weird way to spell "the sun"The NFCE then added the Giants to the list of teams they would like to curb-stomp this season.What the fuck just happened?Imagine they take metcalf at 6 lmao While also being a good singer.as someone who plays a lot of metal on guitar, let me tell you how much of a bitch those early metallica songs are to play. The sheer speed of downpicked chugs is enough to give you carpal tunnel. You should check out the music video. It's cut with scenes from the movie.Very good.The lake of fire in the skyWait... Are you saying that the muted open e-notes in that part of the song are *all*  downpicked??!!If you ain't downpickin, you're cheatin.Congratulations on your good fortune, you beautiful son of a bitch. *Where do bad folks go when they die?*  *They don't go to heaven where the angels fly,*  *They go to a lake of fire and fry,*  *Won't see 'em again til the fourth of July*Aside from some "galloping" like in Disposable Heroes (and the middle section of One referenced earlier in this thread) and others, yes. Riffs like Master of Puppets are all downpicked by JamesJames is known as a great downpicker for a reason. Added to their aggressive soundYup. Master of puppets for example. Up picks are for the WEAK
r/nfl,Bills get a lot of criticism on this sub, but if you look at the stats, no one comes close to Bills in winning Super Bowls.  Bill Belichick, 6 Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII  Bill Walsh, 3 Super Bowls XVI, XIX, XXIII  Bill Parcells, 2 Super Bowl XXI, XXV  Bill Cowher, 1 Super Bowl XL  Brian Billick, 1 Super Bowl XXXV  That's 13 Super Bowls won by the Bills. When will they get the respect they deserve?   *curiously clicks on post*  I don‚Äôt know what I expected.I hate you.  Edit: Thanks for the silver unless you're OP, in which case I stand by my original comment.John Harbaugh's middle initial is W. Someone get to the bottom of this. We might have another Bill. See, this is the kind of crap I WANT to see on April Fools.  Just shitpost-y enough, being lighthearted and fun, but not some fake news massively misleading nonsense.  Well done OP.Yeah but remember that time a literal [Weeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeb_Ewbank) won the superbowl?You're a bad man.I hope you fall down and nobody offers to help you upThis is a GOAT tier shit post, well done OPThey had us in the first half, not gonna lieMods don't delete it is April 1Finally getting the respect we deserve.

Really impressive stuff.Please keep this up Mods, this is great stuff  Damn Bills always playing victim meanwhile they have TWELVE GODDAMN SBs!!It‚Äôs kinda weird that so many coaches named Bill have won a super bowl but I can‚Äôt think of a single QB named Bill to do so.this... is goodCome on Bill O'BrienI thought it said "Bills have been eliminated from the super bowl era"  Still seemed about rightThis should be in r/murderedbywordsr/conspiracy More than twice as many rings as that bum Tom Brady, Bills > Brady confirmed Well played, sir.    A lot better than the subreddit's attempt at an April Fool's joke -at least to me, I didn't watch the half time show, much like I never do, because they are not made for the football fans watching the game.Peak offseason postTake your fucking upvote.Bills?

Your title earned my click.. and now another :(  lolThats a high quality shitpost. This is by far the meanest thing I‚Äôve ever seen someone do.:(I pre-laughed when I saw the headline, wondering what bamboozle was waiting for me.Don‚Äôt forget Bill Polian. He won a SB and had a first round grade on Brady. So that‚Äôs like 7 combined SBs.Now THIS is shitposting!Grade A shitpostFucking got me.Very clever. Someone give this man an award. they had us in the first half not gonna lie  &#x200B;This is the quality of shitposting that led me to oringinally subsribe to this sub. Well done, OP.   &#x200B;  RIP r/bills This is the quality shitposting I've been craving.this was perfect Had us in the first half not gunna lie.I think it‚Äôs because these bills actually use their tables for food? Excellent shit post and props to the Nazi mods for not removing it yet!This is the shitpost we all needed, but not the one we deservedThe perfect r/nfl April fools post. Well doneCounterpoint: Bills have never won a Super Bowl MVP, therefore were carried by their teamTop 3 shot post on this sub BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILLHigh quality off season shitpost. You deserve it all.CheekyMakes me always think of this  https://youtu.be/NyhAJEPEHk4God dammit, I'm so impressed I can't be mad.The Bills have my respect;They are even more dominant if you think about it this way:  Bill Belichick has been to the Super bowl 9 times, Bill Walsh and Bill Parcell went 3 times each, Bill Cowher went 2 times, and the Buffalo Bills have gone 4 times. That's a total of 21 times a Bill has been in the Superbowl in 53 tries, for a percentage of 39.6% of Super Bowls containing a Bill. That's pretty fucking good.Bill Polian with the Colts, too.I knew this was gonna be some sort of pun or wordplayI'm going with APRIL FOOLSThis is the best reddit post This is just a brutal post.  I hope you have the burn ward standing by for those poor fans. Gotta love the offseason shitposts.Ah but if you are the team the Bills, you get there multiple times in a row only to have your heart crushed and then years later get cancer Um, Bill Belichick has 8 rings actually.OP, level with me here. How long have you been waiting to post this?What the actual fuck are you talking about? They made it to the Superb Owl for times straight and‚Äî*reads past the title*...oh. I'm burning you all alive. Nothing like a good April Fools‚Äô goof at the expense of the Billsr/misleadingthumbnailsME: Sees the title   *Downvotes*   Reads the post   *Upvotes*This is a true quality shitpost.So, if Norwood‚Äôs first name was Bill.........?Finally, someone gets us.I love the fact that the mods boomed him the first time, so he legit waited 6 months for April Fool's to come along  LMAO.I love the freakonomic nature of this statistic. Kind of like how such a disproportionate number of serial killers have the middle name Wayne.  Lol @ good ol shoutout to billick.   Phenomenal post my man!They even made 4 straight Superbowls in the 90's.Don't forget Bill Clinton dominating the White House's secretaries Eat a dick.I still will never tolerate anyone making fun of the 90s Buffalo Bills. All year long ESPN highlights were the Bills just throwing bombs into the snow drift lined end zone to slaughter everyone in their path. And going to 4 straight SBs should garner some sort of trophy in itself.   That feat will most likely never happen again.Brian Billick is a stretch Ha. I get it. That shit was goodBill Romanowski has 4 rings as wellFThis is spicyWell all live for high quality shitpost like this Plus, I can't imagine any Ron's or Chad's losing four straight Super Bowls. Leave it to William!Lol you bastard.Fine, take your upvote *grumble grumble*Mordo *did* warn us that the bill comes due.AmazingThis isn't some sort of shitty April Fool's Day joke.

I believe they did not play it, and also most people didn't seem to like the halftime show Maroon 5 put on.

More at 11üôåShort for billip?Here's my expert 20 minutes of research on Wikipedia guess:  The data from that site is based on US social security data, so we're looking at babies born in America and named Donald.   Donald is derived from the Gaelic name D√≤mhnall. From the mid-1800s into the early 1900s there was a massive immigration of Irish people to America, what with the famine and everything.   So the rise of baby Donalds starting in the late 1800s through 1934 could be attributed to the children and grandchildren of the original Irish-speaking immigrants starting to name their children with the Americanized "Donald" rather than the original "D√≤mhnall."  Then in 1934, when the popularity of the name was at its highest, Donald Duck came out, and people didn't want to name their kid after a cartoon duck with a speech impediment. So that's why it dropped off sharply after 1934.From whence you came....Excuse me while I circumvent you.Return whence you came!A Bengals vs Steelers game without at least three injuries is considered a dull affair.I mean I was like 8 or 9 at the time but a man doesn‚Äôt forget his first boobies in the wild.I think the Bills' time was their four SBs in a row.>Someone should convince Belichick that the ultimate challenge would be getting the Bills to the Super Bowl, maybe he will try it before he retires.

Foles was in shotgun and moved behind the offensive lineman faking like he was yelling at him to make an audible.   So Foles walks up to make his "audible" then suddenly the ball is snapped to the RB. Crazy. Play of the year Somewhere Tebow is smiling!

So far he's the only person to have his only reception be a TD in the super bowl, and nick foles is currently on pace for the sameI thought it was crazy when the Lions ran that on a 2 pointer up like 20 against the Packers week 17. Doing that on 4th and goal in the Super Bowl against the Pats is ballsy as fuck. This pretty much ends the Tom Brady vs. Nick Foles debateNot watching this bc it‚Äôs probably a tide ad Won me $100 on squares. Had 2/2I'm so nervous.

Balls of steel going for it there and to pull this play out from the back of the playbook was just brilliant. That's one of those plays you practice for weeks and never, ever run it until this exact situation.That was brilliant. As soon as I saw Foles start to move over I thought "holy crap this is a trick play", such an awesome moment!!This play was something that Offensive Assistant Press Taylor came up with after seeing it in a 2016 week 17 game between the Bears and Vikings:  https://youtu.be/xZRrKll-JGgbe  aggressive  be be  aggressiveFoles > Brady confirmed by GiseleU.S. Bank Stadium has  become the place for teams to use this trick play.

Kraft just sat there with that dumb Alzheimer‚Äôs face he‚Äôs been making for the last couple years.we need to know this man's drag coefficientHe listened to Tenacious D and did his Cock Push-ups. The fact that it happened not long after Brady dropped a pass made it that much better I dunno, man. Even with the homerific excitement coursing through me, Saints halftime onsides is up there.There is no way this doesn't go down as one of the top super bowl plays of all time. A QB catching a TD....not to mention by way of a "fuck you Tom Brady " play. He made Brady his BITCH in one play. Nah the intentional safety against the 49ersI loved it... Run the same play we fucked up on and score a td on it. What a game this has been! Saints onside I think is higherWhy is this a fuck you and not just a smart play?  Honest question, don't watch football, plz don't hateParticularly because it is an exact copy of [this play in the last Pats/Eagles matchup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXuZSj9BtJg) It def was. Especially when the play right before this was an obvious missed PI call. After Brady dropped the same play off his fingertips?  Absolutely the ballsiest thing I've seen someone do to Belichik. At the intersection walking home, I heard the contrast of this play from two houses caddy corner.  "You gotta see this!" and "You gotta be shittin' me!"Same type of play Brady dropped the pass on earlier. That was amazing. I can't believe I watched that happen live. We're gonna see that every Superbowl week until the NFL is over.doug pederson is a godAs someone from Europe watching time to time some Super Bowls, what is the big deal here? For me it looks like a standart play from a textbook. Don't miss the fact Torry Smith is completely uncovered as well. That play worked well enough to get the fake route wide open.I didn‚Äôt clue in that it was a trick play until so late lol. I was like ‚ÄúOH FUCK FOLES ISNT READY AND THEY SNAPPED IT‚Äù.

As simple as possible, you absolutely do not expect the QB to be the intended receiver in a situation like that.Everyone playing out of position, and the least likely player scoring.  If you know soccer, think of it as Lionel Messi taking a goal kick in injury time and scoring, with the ball bouncing all the way to the goal and not a single player is manages to make contact with the ball, as the first half of the World Cup ends and Argentina is now up by 1 goal. There should be no reason for Messi to be back there, there should be no reason for a goal to be scored on a goal kick, no reason for no players to miss the ball, and on the biggest stage of the world.   The quarterback is the offensive leader who is the first to get the ball every play. To do that, he lines up behind the center (the one who transfers the ball to him to begin the play).   He either throws it or gives it to the running back to run forward. The running back is usually positioned very near the quarterback.   The tight end is usually lined up with the rest of the big guys. He is a hybrid in between size of the big and small guys, so he can have the versatility to either block or catch passed balls.   **Here is where things get crazy**  The running back is lined up where the quarterback is lined up 99.9% of plays.   The quarterback is approximately lined up where a tight end is lined up 90% of the tight end‚Äôs plays.   The tight end is lined up away from the big guys, which is maybe 10% of his plays.   During this rare formation, run maybe 1 in 100-500 plays depending on the team, the running back is the first to receive the ball, and 99% of the time in this formation he either he runs it forward or gives it to someone else to run forward. That person is virtually never the tight end. The tight end runs forward on a play maybe 1 in 20,000 plays, because he is usually the one blocking to allow someone faster to run forward.   But he is given to presumably run forward!  But actually he is throwing it! This happens maybe 1 in 20,000 plays as well.   The receiver of the ball is the quarterback, who is thrown the ball maybe 1 in 10,000 plays or so.   **Finally, in a situation like that where a team is only a few yards short of the end zone, and they are on their final play of a series this early in the game, 99.99% they kick a field goal for 3 pts as the probability of getting those 3 points is very high, like 95% in that situation. The probability of scoring a touchdown worth 7 points on a play from that distance is maybe 5-10%, which is why they go for the 95% chance of 3 points and not the 5-10% chance of 7**.   **So, a lot of rare things happened when a running back received the ball first, a tight end threw the ball forward, AND the quarterback caught the ball for a score. ON TOP of that, it‚Äôs on 4th and final down. **  About 4 super rare things happened at the same time, and on the biggest stage of all.   **It‚Äôs kind of like the chances of a goal keeper kicking a ball from midfield with his non-dominant foot and it resulting in a goal, with the ball hitting the head of the striker from the opposing team, who shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near his own goal, but it goes in for an own goal, to score the 10th goal of the game, in the second overtime of the World Cup final game.**  Sorry for any weird explanation, I tried typing while watching the crazy game. So, it was posted elsewhere in the thread, but one of the things you have to know about the quarterback position is that their primary purpose is to either hand off the ball to either a running back (who runs it on the field) or throw it to a receiver. The QB is generally the one throwing the ball to the wide receivers that are running down the field.  Because that basic setup is so fundamental to pretty much every play in football, it gets run A LOT during team practices. What makes this play extraordinary is that it has an intensely psychological element, because it reverses the roles of the players on the field.   By pitching the ball to a tight end, the QB shifted the focus of the defense to the tight end‚Äôs running route. But because they reprioritized their target to the tight end, the quarterback was able to sneak through under the radar, and get completely open in the end zone. Then, in a complete reversal of roles, the tight end (who usually catches the ball) had to throw it to the quarterback (who usually throws the ball and now has to catch it).   Plays like this, called ‚Äútrick plays‚Äù, are difficult to execute well because it forces the athletes performing the plays into roles that they aren‚Äôt used to performing, and forces them to utilize skills that they have not practiced day in and day out. However, again, the psychological element of doing something unexpected (‚Äútricking‚Äù the other team) can be extremely rewarding - but only when you successfully confuse the opposing defense AND complete the pass.   The Eagles succeeded in both of these. The Patriots confused the defense, but the pass did not connect, so it didn‚Äôt matter.   Also, running that *particular* trick play - exactly the same as the one the Patriots attempted and failed earlier in the game - served the double purpose of trying to get the opposing defense to lose focus and start making more mistakes. It sends the message ‚Äúwe can run your playbook better than you can‚Äù, and that can REALLY fuck with the psychological state of the defenders. This is a super weird play to call - Foles is supposed to be throwing, the guy throwing is supposed to be blocking.  On top of that, it was 4th and goal, so if they fuck it up they lose possession of the ball and come away with 0 points.But most importantly  He big dicc niccSlangin his meat and mushroom tatt'ing the PatriotsPederson aswellGif of him throwing air when the ball got knocked out would be great.Similar to [this one](http://i.imgur.com/qUHBky9.jpg).It‚Äôs pretty much the exact same play, that‚Äôs what makes it even better. What's funny is they ran a similar play earlier in this game and fucked it up. I wonder why the Pats tried that play so early in this game. They weren't down by much like they were in that game.I kept talking about this and was wondering why the announcers didn't mention it I can't wait for 5 years from now for the eagles to get their due credit for this incredible season. Nick can. "Well a Quarterback usually throws the ball so I'm not sure he's allowed to catch it. Anyway just makes this incredible comeback Tom Brady is about to pull off even more special. My name is Chris Collinsworth and I want to suck Tom Brady's dick." -Chris Collinsworth, definitely.

Just totally salt the game away and prevent Brady from touching the ball again.One vote for COTY.  One. Vote.  I guess a ring makes that sting a little less.Oh he'll get tons of credit now.That‚Äôs the only way to beat the patriots when it counts. Take risks and score consistently all 4 quarters. His balls will be in focus all week on ESPN.How the fuck he wasn't coach of the year is beyond meWon a superbowl though. Can't turn on him that much for a failed call in the future.I don't get mad -- I understand the rationale behind the anger, though. Something about hindsight being 20/20.  I love when coaches go for it on 4th down, it shows confidence in your team and the ability to get it done when it counts. I love trick plays, the ultimate high-risk high-reward plays. I will never fault our coaches for betting on our team.  My ultimate hope is to see a coach wager a super bowl on a two point conversion as time expires, when a PAT would tie. It‚Äôs now officially legendary!When Brady tried it first, I literally turned to my friend and said, "That was dumb. But to be fair, if he'd pulled it off it would have been legendary." I had no fucking idea. Legendary!![deleted]What a unit But having the kickstand helps with stability. >What can‚Äôt he do?  Have a small dick. I know he can‚Äôt lose super bowl 52, that‚Äôs for sure. I have no doubt that was intentional. With two weeks practice they definitely have more than a few trick plays up their sleeve to choose from, and having just seen the Patriots try that shit they absolutely wanted to take Brady down a peg. It's rare to see a QB thrown to in a whole season and we just saw it twice in 5 minutes. Not coincidence. It was incredible. That is going to be shown in commercials and shit for decades. I instantly remembered the Gissele quote and started laughing. First Mariota and now Big Dick NickAfter being the two QBs with the top 2 single season TD:INT ratio, Foles needed to let Brady know.Only because they tried and failed throwing to Brady earlier. it was targeted.Hey, we haven‚Äôt kicked off for the second half yetNah man, this would be like if the Saints had come out with an onside after the Colts had already failed to convert an onside attempt earlier in the gameEasy, bro. Colts fan hereI watched that kick with my grand father who was a saints fan. He passed away a couple years ago and this is still my fondest memory of him. I get happy every time I see it mentioned. Let's wait how the Eagles are starting the second half. I've been calling it The "Fuck you Bill" play since it happened, "Fuck you Tom Brady" works too, but it was more about out coaching in my mind. Also, I thought the Pats play was extra fucking stupid because "let's pass to the guy wearing a Michael Jackson glove who just had hand surgery" is all I was thinking when Brady bobbled.That wasn't really a fuck you, just the smartest thing they could have done to run out the clock in that scenario.[deleted]The Foles TD was cool, the Saints onside kick was one of the ballsiest plays in Super Bowl history. Got a video? The Patriots tried to do something similar not long before and failed at it.[removed]Foles>Brady confirmed?   Get your hot takes hereUnless Pats come back and win and have an impressive play of their own. Great plays are always forgotten in losing efforts. Yeah we are. And I'm looking forward to it that was amazingBig dicks must be a requirement for the EaglesTruly amazed by his progression. This has been a fun game to watchDude has balls of steel.  That was wild. Best play call of my life.time out. This was at the least lifted from the lions: https://youtu.be/wqDQghmzAtY. and I think the pats were the original team to run it a few years ago, we just reintroduced itFound not-mike-lombardi riding the top comments here: why didn't BB call a time out after that huge gain that led to 1st and goal? Seems like there was no reason not toThe Quarterback, who normally throws the ball, was the one who caught it. It was thrown by the Tight End(normally a blocking or receiving position), generally referred to as a trick play.  As the other guy explained, the guy who caught the ball for the touchdown is the guy who is normally throwing it.  This is the first time the quarterback has caught a touchdown in *Superbowl history*, which makes it an even bigger deal beyond just being a unique play that's difficult to executeHoly shit. He's just standing there...> OH FUCK FOLES ISNT READY AND THEY SNAPPED IT  BWOAH HE HAS TROUBLE WITH THE SNAPTom Brady is a [strong single woman](https://i.imgur.com/ZF2EZb7.jpg) who is trying to feed 3 kids without a man.

He was tanking for the wrong sport and nobody knew. 4d chess right there But they didn't do it.  They attempted it.  The Eagles actually did it.That makes it an even bigger fuck you.That‚Äôs true, but it also wasn‚Äôt done during the Super Bowl. Yeah, but this one worked lolCollinsworth was hot garbage all gameAight, thanks! Is this what the Patriots tried to do earlier, when Brady fumbled it? >  The probability of scoring a touchdown worth 7 points on a play from that distance is maybe 5-10%  Liked your explanation a lot except this bit. I'd imagine the likelihood of scoring from the 1 is something closer to 15-20%.r/theydidthemathGotta say you killed this explanation like it was AlderranI...I still don't get it, sorry.  Did the QB take the hike, pass it off to a tight end or a runner or whoever, who threw it to...someone who wasn't a reciever, in a situation where most would kick?  I did see the throw and was like "that was one wobbly throw, it either slipped or that guy wasn't the QB".  [Edit]  Okay holy crap, so they had a tight end throw to the quarter back who caught it for a TD, who is also just a backup quarter back the Eagles played as a starter in the most important game for them ever.  Jesus Christ.  Who also is the first player ever to throw a TD pass and score a TD from a pass in Superbowl Finals history...that's...yeah that's impressive.  I'm just now picturing that scene from The Longest Yard:  Patriots: HEY! Is that legal!?  Eagles: Yes it is.  Patriots: Is that a touch down!?  Eagles: Yes it is.  Patriots: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?FUCKING BUILD THEM Oh I LOVED that little bullshit moveThe down really takes away from the risk of the play though.   And the venue. This. Honestly I feel like there will be 30 for 30s and documentaries on this Eagles football season. They overcame so got damn much and beat the greatest QB/Coach duo of all time. But they never really beat anybody.> My name is Chris Collinsworth and I *am* sucking Tom Brady's dick."      FTFYAnd Clemson did it five years ago. Nothing in football is ever new.   [Clemson Two Point Play](https://youtu.be/bqJqaqFiwds)I definitely agree the GAINZ are real!!The call it the Lombardi Trophy.It's like power rangers, transformers, Captain Planet, etc.   So yes  McVay was very deserving of the COTY because of his turning around of that beat down Rams franchise but the fact that Pederson only got one vote is beyond stupid. He had one hell of a season, one hell of a playoff run, and was able to put together a hell of a gameplan to beat the Hoodie. He‚Äôs locked in as the coach for the next 8+ years. Just to be clear I think it's the right thing no matter what. But the people that freaked out over BB going for it on 4th and 2 would do the same. But yeah, kudos to him for his ballsy play calling.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHThe Pats actually ran that same exact played when the Eagles played them in 2015 and it worked.Like a damn kickstand. Kangaroo TailHe must hate potholes.So he can‚Äôt be a redditor. Got it.  In your face Nick!!!!Somebody won a huge payday on a Foles TD catch prop bet somewhere. definitely psychological, even Brady wouldn't have been able to help being put off by that, even just a tiny bit.They took the play from Baker Mayfield in the Rose Bowl. It‚Äôs not a coincidence because they‚Äôve both been practicing it since early January They did it because they thought it would score a touchdown, it had nothing to do with "taking Brady down a peg".It was seriously the onfield equivalent of Foles wipping out his dick LBJ style in front of Brady like, "you aint man enough for this"This play will be shown forever.  When ever Superbowl LII is talked about in the future, this play be the one that gets aired.  I need to get me a photo frame that plays videos and have this play on repeat at work, forever.Yeah this one is on another level for sure.    Oh, that *sneaky* play you tried and failed?  Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done..  for a touchdown..  bitchSorry, forgot the trigger warning.  I did love that Super Bowl, though, because it was two guys who I wanted to see win it.But again, the other team didn't attempt and fail at the same play earlier.  This fact seperates this as a better "fuck you" play.But, the saints were not literally showing up a play attempted by the opposing team 3 minutes before.  That pushes it ahead for me.  What a giant FUCK YOUI think it is THE ballsiestMaybe they‚Äôre both just huge ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù plays!Here : https://youtu.be/upOmjohOvb4  They called an onside kick to start the Superbowl second half against the Colts.Thanks!Burton is a TE, played QB at Florida thoughClement to Burton to Foles, holy shit. I can't wait to rewatch this over and over and memorize exactly where everyone was positioned for the rest of my life.Foles to win 6 Super Bowls now, Brady retires in shameWell, obviously. Brady hasn't even won a Superbowl this year.A la the leg catch in the Seahawks Super Bowl.Reminds me of that Julio catch in last year's Super Bowl. Such a great throw/catchJulio Jones catch last year comes to mindThat's just for an interview.  You need balls of steel to get a job.Can you recall any qb with a career arc like Foles? Or even close?   I guess Kurt Warner, but Foles was no one 6 weeks ago!It's not the specific play design as much as it is calling the play on 4th and 1 in the superbowl.  It's easy to call it when you're up 20 in the fourth.Nah dude, Longest Yard trick play. Paul Crew is the real OG here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr-W2awYfcMOh, now i can see it, nice play. Thanks for the explanation!And it was ballsy because it was 4th and not necessarily because that's such an insane move, right?https://i.imgur.com/h7BMP8y.jpgyou must be knew to PFT. it‚Äôs part of his shtickif u care more about SPELLING then TELLING theirs the doorBig dick Nick has that effectHahaha... :'(Technically, you could do both at the same time, it'd just require a bit of coordination.why not both?Brady not Mariota confirmedShoutout Wes Welker though lolInfinitely better.Girls only like guys who have great skills.On 4th and goal. On 4th and 1Not a single word from Cris, just left Al hanging.   Probably silently screaming inside trying to find a way that it couldn‚Äôt possibly be a catch. Yup!The answer to the question you meant to ask is yes, but you should know that "fumbled" in American football means to actually have possession of the ball and then drop it, which isn't what Brady did... he just didn't catch it. I did the calculation for "Butler interception" Superbowl and the odd for 1-2 yards from goal line  and succeed is about 40-50%.It is as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in understanding and were suddenly silenced.>Nothing in football is ever new.   That's a lie, never seen the Eagles win a Super Bowl before!   For anyone who is interested;  [Here](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Trey+Burton+Mississippi+State+v+Florida+v6UPcxj4WrQl.jpg) is Trey Burton when he was a Gator.

Mcvay deserved it, but one vote is fucking nonsense.Gotta love it, your name is a ballsy playcall itselfAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFool me once, shame on... Shame on you. Fool me-can't get fooled again.It actually is like a pendulum when needed. When not needed it keeps his center of gravity thicc.> dickstandPogo StickI look at a lot of props...  that wasn‚Äôt offered anywhere I saw.     Would have been 750/1 - 1000/1 only because the books never go higher. A friend's wife bet both that Foles would score a non-passing TD and that he'd get MVP. Too bad she just bet $3...I wonder what the odds werewhy not bothMorale and confidence are a huge part of the game. The priority was obviously making the play and scoring, but getting in Brady's head was probably also part of it. alright guys, we're 5th and goal in the biggest game of our lives, what play can we make that would bring brady down a peg?  offensive coordinator, probably It only takes him down a peg if they think they'd score. Of course they picked a play that they thought would help them win by scoring, it can also be true they they saw the unique advantage such a play could present.Big Dick NickI put on my FB page...that was Pederson going "Oh that was a cute play Bill...here is how its properly done"> I need to get me a photo frame that plays videos  damm you harry potter bro?I mean alshons insane catch was pretty up there too...Game. Blouses.On 4th downI don‚Äôt see the on-sides as a fuck you play as much as I see it as strategy. They were playing Peyton is his prime. Try the onside kick and steal a possession away. If you don‚Äôt recover it the damage is minimal because it‚Äôs very likely Manning would have covered the yardage easily anywayWhat's the significance of an onside kick?Helps that no one likes the patriots tooAdding onto that, it's a very rare play. Seeing it twice in a season would be unusual, let alone twice in a game, let alone twice in the biggest game of the season[removed]TB88 with a TD pass in the superbowl. Best trio of TEs in the leagueOh yea. That‚Äôs where that guy is now. I remember the brief Tebow comparisons from his first year at Florida. He just did to Brady what the Jags did to MarinoOr Julio toe tap last yearThe what?Steel will only get you a waterboy job fair enoughAnytime my friend, hope you enjoy the game :)Both! It's ballsy to go for it on 4th down, and pretty insane to do that and have this be your play to go for it. Crazy stuff[deleted]That would be an accurate assessmentDick = bigIt might hurt at first, but then starts to feel pretty good actuallyInb4 AB throws a bomb to Ben instead. Against the PatriotsI kind of like that. Let the crowd noise and moment speak for itself.This is also an incredibly rare/risky play that may happen only a few times in a year across all teams. To see two in a Superbowl is unheard of.You‚Äôve got me there!https://i.imgur.com/iTU6A96.gifvIn soccer, some leagues in Europe have a voting system where you can award three points, two points, and one point to a coach when voting for a Coach of the Year/Month Award, depending on the league.  IIRC they do that as well for World Player of the Year awards.Like a damn cheetah tailAnd they lose their ass on that kind of prop I'd imagine. Probably not enough people betting against cause you'd only make a fraction of a penny on a dollar. The people betting for wouldn't have to hedge much at all and could expect a huge return for minimal risk.What did it pay? let nick be nick [Breakfast can wait.](https://imgur.com/to50WqJ)[deleted]It's considered an incredibly risky play. If it doesn't work out, your opponent can end up with the ball between your 45 or their 45 which is midfield. It has such a low success rate that it's only run in situations with no other alternative.   Starting a half like that is a way to totally change the momentum of the second half. Rather than giving a possession away, you take it and potentially ruin the opponents second half gameplan. No problem! I can't believe you've done this.Except brady put up 505 yards and 3 TDs That play was the last time I had hope that night. https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/seahawks-get-lucky-super-bowl.gif?w=1000Exactly/r/wholesomereddithttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/R390EIdKirk*After they tried the same play and fucking failed. As we saw, it takes a HoF QB to pull it off. The best explanation yet. They make there money on those best failing more than 999 in 1000 times.They don't need to make money on people betting against it they make money on the ~1000 times where it doesn't happen. (Same with every prop bet), people very rarely bet against a prop bet.If it was before the season, a trillion to one.Like $30. It wasn't a parlay, but they were both close to 10-1Why not just kick it softly then? Does your opponent have to touch it first? Thank you for the reply!Don't worry, you'll find someone new soon.  Probably around the same time my guys do.In a happier alternate universe that catch is in the end zone.wtfDamn it. I knew one of these would be the oneThat's the best picture of Brady I've ever seen. Thanks this is the one i wantedGOATfaceI AM SO ERECTThe only explanation .Imagine telling /r/nfl in August ‚Äúyeah Big Dick Nick Fucking Foles is gonna *catch* a TD pass in the SB this year. And they win. And Foles wins MVP in that game. Against the Pats.‚Äù  The last part is the only part anyone would believe.What book was Foles 10-1 for MVP? MGM was +400 and Bovada was +325.The ball must go at least 10 yards before the kicking team can attempt to recover it. This means the kicker has to kick it into the ground. Here is the kick by the Saints in 2010!   https://youtu.be/upOmjohOvb4The kicking team can't touch the ball until the ball has moved down 10 yards, and the returning team usually has players at that distance in the field. Because of that, it's *very* hard to pull off.Yes, who saw a skinny bald pic of Brady coming? Certainly not I.Change Foles to Manning and more would have believed it.Not huge into betting, but does +400 mean put 400 to win 100, or put 100 to win 400?No idea, wasn't my bet. She just said she won $30 off two bet totaling $3. I didn't hire a private investigator to follow up. Oh wow! I can't tell whether that was sheer luck or sheer brilliance. Probably a bit of both. Thanks again!Latter. If it were a minus instead of the plus, the former would apply.Typical success rate of onsides kick is about 10% I think, but usually it's obvious you're trying. Dunno how you factor in the full blown surprise factor here, but the odds are still sketchy

Mariota playing 7D chessCalculated!Modern Era music city miracleKid won a game for a coach that doesn‚Äôt deserve him. I really hope somehow he gets a some better leadership next year. Super MariotaI shit my pants, what the fuck Why can‚Äôt this shit happen during the fantasy season. Best play ever and the announcers acting like it was a routine play. Terrible call by the announcer.The ref said he was an eligible receiver because he was in shotgun. Does that mean if he were under center he couldn't have legally caught the ball? How would that make a difference, since he's not on the line of scrimmage in either formation?I need a name for this play like ‚ÄúMusic City Miracle‚ÄùGisele: "My husband can't throw it to himself!"  Mariota: "Hold my non-alcoholic beverage."I thought he was passed the line of scrimmage. Not just foot, but when he released the ball. That was awesome Sick!Immaculate reception 2.0 we just witnessed history.My sports app said mariota passes to mariota for TD.. This explains a lot Weirdest play of the year. This will be an awesome trivia question 20 years from now.Mariota is a stable genius...like really smart. Had a discussion last night with a buddy of mine and he mentioned Titans lacking reliable receivers for Mariota. I told him Super Mariota can just pass to himself. Glad I was right.Giselle- "My husband can't throw the ball and catch it"  Mariota- Hold my beerThis shit is going to be a consistent animation in the next Madden.Best TD of the yearGreat Heads up Play by himWhat a legend. So does that count as a pass TD and a recieving TD in fantasy?Jesus, don't let Giselle see this.2mariota4meThe poor chiefs players are like "are you fucking kidding me?"This commentator is SO BAD.What in the fucking bugs bunny football play is this foolishness. fuck this game. I'm embarassed.Dude holy crap the reaction time on that run in. No pause at all. He throws it, he catches it, and he runs it in like it was the plan. Incredible.Can we get a sticky post here explaining how it wasn't an illegal forward pass? Half the thread is people saying he was past the LOSTurning point of the game. Titans don‚Äôt win if that play is stopped.So, does he get credit for two touchdowns in his stats even though only one was scored? Curious how the NFL will show the total number of touchdowns for him.  Oh, and hooray Marcus. Love this guy.As a kid I would toss a football to myself while playing in the backyard. Because I was a stupid kid I would imagine I was throwing a super bowl winning TD pass to myself. When I got a little older I learned that wasn‚Äôt possible. Mariota out there basically living my childhood fantasyLike, I almost feel bad for Revis after that, but then I remember all the shit he put us through, I don‚Äôt feel as bad anymore. That‚Äôs fucking hilarious.If they make a run, this will be legend. Anyone come up with a name for it yet? The KC Masterpiece?I was more impressed about the block he gave later on... that was a really good play that ended in a 1st downHe one-upped Favre, lol.My fiancee and I were at a bar watching the game when this play occurred. Obviously the bar went nuts when it happened. After it was over, my fiancee said "that seemed to work really well. Why don't more teams try and score like that." I honestly have no clue how to respond. Is it weird that this turns me on a little bit?That was impressive pulling in that terrible throw into coverage.  Totally bailed his QB out there what a stud.Simpsons knew it all along http://i.imgur.com/tW8enYf.gifCALCULATED!Gisele: ‚ÄúTom can‚Äôt throw AND catch the ball!‚Äù  Mariota: ‚ÄúHold my beer‚ÄùThe call stood? Please tell me it stood.Holy shit what a playBrett Favres first pass was deflected back to him for a completion. Although not for a touchdown.What boring announcers where's the excitement on such a crazy play.The only one who can pass to me, is me.  - Marcus "Aomine Daiki" MariotaWe on the front page boys.    Spread the word of MariGOATa Revis was the who deflected too!Holy hellMy fantasy squad is rolling over in their graves Mariota was the Titans' best QB, WR, and Offensive Lineman for this game.Well if that doesn't fire up his Titans teammates I don't know what would. The man is a magician. What a play!KC native here. I still can't believe this $#%& is happening. Obviously our D didn't show up.  But this... this didn't help.Holy hell what a play... What a player. God damn.What is that 10 or 11 fantasy points?Mariota finally realized the best person to pass to was himselfDid you know that Marcus Mariota's first playoff touchdown pass was to himself?What position group did Marcus mariota throw his first playoff touchdown to? Brett Favre‚Äôs first completion was to himself I believe Remember the time Marcus mariota threw a td pass to hall of fame Jet Brett Favre? Guess who Brett Favre's first completion was too[Not as perfect as this time, but close enough. ](https://youtu.be/8iK7vRYeY3U)    Edit: 45 seconds Brady should leave her for MariotaThis is by far the best comment in this thread.Dude... that was one hell of a quote, couldn‚Äôt have fit that in any better than a Brady to Walker pass in the Super Bowl.  *EDIT: WELKER. Freaking mobile autocorrect.Lmao this is perfectCrowd went through an emotional roller coaster there. My friend and I went to grab beer at halftime and got stuck in line, so we were following the start of the 2nd half in the car on TheScore.   There was a disclaimer that they were having difficulties with updates for that game (like it would randomly say the score was 0-0). I updated my friend (huge Titans fan) that Mariota threw a TD. She was ecstatic and asked who caught it. I told her it said Mariota, so we assumed this was part of the technical issues.   Craziest play of the year, and yet it was somehow right. *Writes down play for Carr to try next year*I love how he showed the only other time this happened by holding up a video text from Brad Johnson himself. Imma miss the guy.Spider 2 Yourself BananaThis but unironically. Decker def would have dropped thatYou're not wrongWhatever happened to Corey Davis? I don't follow the titans but I loved him at WMU https://twitter.com/AnalyticsPlant/status/949788086732337152I will never recover from this if we somehow lose.   edit: i'm drunk and everyoen that responds to this post gets a downvote fuck you allFlashbacks to Luck's fumble touchdown. Would have been the most Titans play ever if Mariota had fumbled out of the end zone while reaching for the goal lineSeriously that was such a awful pass in the first place  Edit: Taking a lot of downvotes for this. It was still a amazing play but could of easily been a int.  https://i.imgur.com/9I0VoeW.jpgChiefs getting a big early lead, losing big players to injury, fluke td for the opposing team...

Really impressive 2nd half.Gisele: "My Husband Can Not Fucking Throw The Ball And Catch The Ball At The Same Time!"  Mariota: "Hold my beer."Streets aheadStable GeniusCalculated.Luck's superman dive? Do you mean the recovered fumble that he took in for a TD after his RB fumbled at the goal line? Wasn't that against the Chiefs as well?I'm getting way to much PTSD right now.  Yeah. Jon Gruden showed that to me on his cell.That's awesomeThey just showdd this play. By zooming in on grudens cell phoneThis is the only other time it's ever happened. How do y‚Äôall say this shit?   Every time I screw up or feel I should‚Äôve defended better, I‚Äôll hit the team with a nice Canadian:  ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù  Every time one of my teammates scores a sweet goal, I‚Äôm in there with a supportive:  ‚ÄúNice Shot!‚Äù ‚ÄúNice Shot!‚Äù ‚ÄúNice Shot!‚Äù  But for the life of me, I cannot figure out where ‚ÄúCalculated.‚Äù is. More like r/nfl in November 2018 lolNo more like ‚ÄúPlease pay $1.99 to find out who was Mariota‚Äôs first playoff TD was too?! You won‚Äôt believe!‚ÄùHe gets that in real life too!http://puu.sh/yVNgN/49c508a9b7.png  Looks like it >beer  How dare you suggest such a thingUNDERRATED COMMENT He had the athleticism to catch that ball after he was pushed, and then make a dive for the endzone. Just a wtf play overall. Are we the only ones who feel this way? I am giddy from this play, it was incredible. We won't see that again in our lives I wouldn't think.Wow, I had no dog in this fight, but after that play I want Mariota to win this.. Also because Peters is acting like a bitch.Wait wasn't he like so clearly over the LOS tho??? I don't understand how that stood as a pass can someone explain? Well she‚Äôs not wrong, her husband can‚Äôt. Mariota isn‚Äôt her husband though lol I didn't even get to enjoy the touchdown because I thought for sure he had gone over the line of scrimmage. AgreedHe needs to be fully over the line.  Think his foot wasn't.I believe his entire body has to be past the line.Only your back foot has to be behind the line.   It‚Äôs in the rule book. Entire body has to be past the line of scrimmage.His foot was on the ground behind itSecond career receiving TDCame to ask this question. Also, doesn't it not matter anyway, since the ball touched a defensive player first?Shouldn't matter at all.  Once a ball is tipped every player on the field is allowed to go for it.  The eligible receiver bit was odd because he wasn't throwing (unbeknownst to everyone) to himself.He should go coach for the Raiders.Probably looking at the "unofficial" black line on TV (I too thought it was illegal) but the refs and the NFL okay'd the scoring play.  Because not every team has "I'm just here for the paycheck" Darelle Revis on it to deflect a pass back to the QB. lol*water[The announcers only like the Chiefs](https://www.facebook.com/deadspin/posts/10159822228885072) Marcus ‚ÄúLeBron James‚Äù Mariota He is the only one (except for the KC defense) that hasn't dropped a pass[fuck you Jobu I do it myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsjoFZEwAyI)if you want something done right, gotta do it yourself...Did you know Jimmy Graham used to play basketball?Did you know Marcus Mariota's ONLY touchdown pass in the playoffs was to himself?!  Edit: :(TIL  ...I was being sarcastic but now I realize it‚Äôs still trueMariota - 1 Gisele - 0If you want a job done right...Super Mario just touched one of those flashing glow stars at half time to become invincible in the 2nd half.  Point Center!I'm just here for the Brady-Jimmy G- Mariota love triangle dramaI, for one, would accept our new gay QB overlordsDude, imagine that football pedigree. You mean Gisele is leaving Brady for Marriotta.  "finally, a husband that can pass and catch."  -Gisele, imaginablySpider 2 Y MariotaI thought Mariota was going to pull a Carr when he dove into the endzone, holding the ball out. (Pulling a Carr meaning he was going to fumble it through the endzone, resulting in the Chiefs getting the ball at the 20.)That was great. Like fuck ESPNs stats and video crew. He's got that shit locked down in memory. And the camera zoomed into his phone!  Only other self pass for a TD.   Brett Farve's first pass in the NFL was to Brett FarveThanks for Decker but not really.   EDIT: jkOn a side note I hope they use their top draft picks on giving Mariota some people to pass toHeeee heeeaaard yooouuuBest I understand he came into the season with a leg injury that he never really shook. As a WMU alum and huge Davis fan, hoping he has a big year next year.I'm convinced we are cursed if so.Logan Paul‚Äôs next video: Live from /u/KUSmurf ‚Äòs house.Uh.... You ok budI'm just here for the downvoteSorry brotherRIPüëÄüëÄReal tough loss today, but I hope you recover and think of your awesome Royals. At the 2 minute warning, I think I have some bad news about your ability to recover.U doin ok bud?As a Falcons fan - I'm sorry. That was rough. Good luck with your recovery I have bad news, friend.Seems like you guys need to be away to win in the playoffs. Go Lers!As a Bills fan, thank you for not making our shiny first-rounder worse.And we're already down two star players. Just like that fucking game. Except he didn't so now it's the most Chiefs play ever.Or if he got tackled a yard short. God he was about as close as he could be to the LOS. He was looking right at the defenders and thought "gee, I'd better throw it right at them, they'll never expect that."One of the most hardest hitting safeties in the leeeague!HOLD MA DIIIICCCKKKKDawg I gotta do this shit. My leg broke blllpppp duuubllbpp"My mom told me to pass it to myself" -Mariota probablyFuck it, touchdown...How is he running with a broke fucking leg 2nd time in NFL history, I believe. Brad Johnson did it for the Vikings in 1997.[deleted]QB catches his only TD pass of the game. As cool as that play was, this might be the only consolation if the Titans lose. I can live with that.   Edit: This comment aged brilliantly. Thanks for another awesome season KC. Has anything like this happened ever? In a playoff game too!Ha'ah'ha*quacking*Mr. Perfect has done this before but this is the first I've seen during a game.  edit: link to [Mr Perfect](https://youtu.be/8iK7vRYeY3U?t=52)GB has Rodgers to Rodgers  SEA has Wilson to Willson  And now TEN has Mariota to Mariota**FUMBLED INTERCEPTION**Exotic fucking smashmouth lolThey just showed this highlight on the TV . . . by having Gruden hold his phone up in front of the camera because Brad had sent the video to him"Courtesy ESPN"   That was arguably the shittiest view possible of the throw and catch.Bucs legend Brad Johnson[deleted]That studder step though üí¶What a scrub. Can‚Äôt believe they let him in the hall of fame. First completed pass. First pass was an interception.Maybe even this game. Yes, it's a passing TD and a receiving TD.[deleted]When the ref made the call he specifically said "Because he was in the shotgun formation, the quarterback was an eligible receiver"   So I took that as a completed pass to himselfI think that‚Äôs how many points I scored in my championship gameIn 1 PPR that's more than 3 of his games this year.  And with 5 more games 16 or under that's dangerously close to being a top game for him this year in 1 play. BBY what happened11.84 in pprLooking like it. He is so bland.well, in this case it sounds like Gis is just making a lateral move.And that stiff arm last week to lock that game down. Mariota's not scared of taking a hitA thing like that is going to make the whole team play harder next week. What mariota showed in this game is the type of heart missing from alot of top teir qbs out there, he'll be fun to watch for a long time. You would never see aaron rodgers throw a block like that, he would just stand there looking disgusted.*chucks beer at defender, scores touchdown, catches beer*Fun fact: Mariota says he has never taken a single sip of alcohol in his entire life. If you have to ask you're streets behindLove a good community referenceChiefs ahead. Like, really smartYeah exactly. Freak touchdowns in the wildcard round against the Chiefs. I have PTSD.Yes.  Now never talk about it again.Yes that's why he brought it up.

Bam Bam Bam> Are we the only ones who feel this way  300 comments in 10 minutes suggests *no.* I'm glad I saw it live. She‚Äôs now found a man who can do both! She should dump that scrub in Boston that can‚Äôt do the same. Why did the refs not call it back? Only 2 TD's in 3 years? What a bust.According to the rule book, eligible receivers include "all other offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player" after a legal forward pass. So you're right, it seems like it wouldn't matter since it was tipped. The ref must have been wrong or didn't communicate what he was trying to say.*KOBE*Marcus ‚ÄúLeBron ‚ÄòBrett Favre‚Äô James‚Äù MariotoObviously not, since the kc defense dropped the pass he caughtEveryone knows that.

Mariota just threw a TD to Decker for the go-ahead TD.  He already has one and gets another game to try to get another, all thanks to the Kansas City Chokes.P O S I T I O N L E S S F O O T B A L LI don't know of this "Brady" or "Mariota" you speak of but I see you are familiar with our lord and savior Jimmy Garoppolo. Imma watch this pornBut Aaron Rodgers already holds that title I thought? Man I tell ya  Spider 2 Y Marioturkey HoleOh man I cracked up at this oneSpider 2 Y PineappleTHIS IS WHAT I CALL THE MARIOTA POWERPLAY.Bears did that too. Only it was a John Fox challenge for the TD instead of being out at the 1, only for it to be overturned as a fumble out of the end zone... SMHSteve young did it as well and was just two yards from the TD pass/receptionIt was his first completed pass. His first pass was an interception. Naturally.DECKER REDEMPTIONRedeemed himself though!Best edit.Flashes of brilliance but no true breakout game. He draws quite a bit of the opposing secondary's attention though. I'm already convinced we are Maybe you built the stadium on an Indian burial ground or something. The combo of this plus Luck recovering a fumble and scoring against you in the playoffs definitely smells like a curse.you didnt know already? JesusNo üò•I fucking still argue with my friends that we win that game if Jamaal doesn‚Äôt go down on the first play of the game. Like seriously, you don‚Äôt think the best RB in the NFL that year is worth more than a FG?? To be fair, they did not expect it‚ÄúI‚Äôll bounce it off their hands so they can‚Äôt catch it‚ÄùFUCK YOU GUMBYI'll do dis shit.. FOR MADDEN> My ~~leg~~ **hamstring** broke    But seriously.

Please tell me this is trueFootball Can't believe you're calling Vikings legend Brett favre a scrubDefinitely the TD of the drive.Dang, in a PPR league that like a 11.5 point playDid you lose to someone with Todd Gurley on their team?Did you win? Can the QBs get receiving points in ESPN standard PPR?...and Titans are winning >Mariota's not scared of taking a hit  no, but we fans are scared when he takes a hit.It was Mariota, not Gronk...Have you ever seen Mariota and Steve Austin in the same room? Didn't think so. \#DuckFactsBeen there coined thatnot anymoreEspecially the Texans one in 2015. Oh wait...he puts the ball in his own handsWe might never see another play like that again. I guess the entire body needs to be beyond the LOS (when I first saw this play, I thought it would be coming back, thinking the *ball* couldn't be beyond the LOS).  Pausing the replay, half of Mariota's foot is on the LOS as the ball is released - super lucky.[deleted]I actually didn't Did you know Ryan Fitzpatrick went to Harvard?Nope!:(I went to his wrestling camp when I was in high school. Megan Fox was still big so that‚Äôs the example he used for teaching us how to pop our hips when throwing people.  ‚ÄúYou only get one really good pop, so make it count.‚Äù   Most effective teaching method my fifteen year old self experienced that year That trivia didn't last long...You guys can‚Äôt be cursed. Y‚Äôall have burnt ends, Boulevard, and the Royals won a chip a few years ago. KC is basically heaven.   Edit: ok you might be cursed after that missed FG. As soon as that play happened, I knew the Chiefs were doomed. We‚Äôve seen this movie before. The Chiefs find new ways every year to lose in the most painful way possible. It would be different if they were blown out; less painful. Instead we have a list of postseason losses that each have a name. There was the No Punt Game. There was the Blown 38-10 Lead Game. There was the Steelers No TD Loss Game. Now there‚Äôs the Forward Progress/Mariota to Mariota TD Game.     I hate everything. [deleted]It's like what people say about the American military. There's no way the enemy can know what you're going to do if you don't even know what you're going to do.Learning from the Matt Ryan school of passing and receiving.Oh shit, it's Darren SharperThat happens fairly regularly. Favre‚Äôs is trivia because it was the first pass he ever completed.I bet if there was a way to throw an interception to yourself, Favre would have figured it out.His first playoff TD ever, in fact! Now get used to hearing that every game for the rest of his career...Damn, Johnson shuffling and juking like Walter Payton.That was literally 20 years ago I can't believe he didn't throw it again...feel like that would just be a natural reaction!

r/nfl,In the Chicago Bears roast thread, 69memelordharambe420 posted "There are more Bears than Bears fans." That got me thinking: Is that true? And more generally, which teams have fewer fans than there exist whatever they're named after?  To start, I needed a rough estimate of the number of NFL fans in the world. This turned out to be difficult to find. I found several reasonable estimates that ranged from 200,000,000 to 400,000,000, but the average estimate seems to be about 300,000,000, so I decided to go with that. If you prefer a different estimate, you can easily scale all of the final numbers up or down as needed.  Of those 300,000,000, about [90%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660525/most-popular-nfl-teams-in-us/), or 270,000,000, consider themselves fans of one team in particular. To find out how these 270,000,000 fans apportion themselves among the 32 teams, I used [this page](http://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-liked-nfl-teams-on-facebook/page/1/), which lists how many likes each team has on Facebook (it lists the St. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers but still has accurate numbers for the Facebook likes, I checked), and calculated the total number of likes across the 32 teams: 91,712,968. Then, I took the number of likes for each team and multiplied it by 270,000,000/91,712,968 (then rounded to the nearest whole number) to get the best estimate that I was realistically going to be able to get for the total number of fans that each team has. Here are my results:  Bears: There are roughly 12,092,476 Bears fans. There are [eight species of bear, plus the grizzly-polar hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bears). I won't go through all of my calculations, but I came up with a final number of 1,148,364. There are more Bears fans than bears.  Lions: There are roughly 5,642,181 Lions fans. The worldwide lion population is somewhere around [20,000](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/). There are more Lions fans than lions.  Packers: There are roughly 16,024,215 Packers fans. I don't really feel like doing extensive research on the worldwide meatpacking industry, but the U.S. meatpacking industry employs about 148,100 and there is no way that there are a hundred times that number outside of the country. There are more Packers fans than packers.  Vikings: There are roughly 6,200,740 Vikings fans. The Viking Age ended nearly a millennium ago. There are more Vikings fans than Vikings.  Cowboys: There are roughly 25,758,315 Cowboys fans. There are currently [less than 9,730](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy#Modern_working_cowboys) cowboys in the United States. Again, there's no way there are over a thousand times more cowboys elsewhere. There are more Cowboys fans than cowboys.  Eagles: There are roughly 8,888,974 Eagles fans. This one was a lot harder than I was anticipating, but there are 60 different species of eagle. Two of the most common are the bald eagle (70,000 in the world) and the most common eagle in Europe, the [spotted eagle](http://www.kotkas.ee/species/spotted-eagles) (40,000 in the world). Based on this, I highly doubt that the average eagle species has a worldwide population of more than 100,000, an estimate which would yield a total eagle population across all species of 6,000,000 (remember, this is most likely a wild overestimate). There are almost certainly more Eagles fans than eagles.  Giants: There are roughly 11,690,931 Giants fans. Giants are mythological creatures. There are more Giants fans than giants.  Redskins: I'm not touching this one.  Buccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer), the term "buccaneer" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.  Falcons: There are roughly 6,009,462 Falcons fans. The common kestrel (5,000,000 worldwide) and Merlin (1,300,000 worldwide) alone cover this number, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falconiformes_by_population). There are more falcons than Falcons fans.  Panthers: There are roughly 7,034,101 Panthers fans. "Panther" is kind of a loosely defined term, but the genus *Panthera* includes tigers (3,890 worldwide), lions (20,000), jaguars (15,000), leopards (250,000), and snow leopards (6,000). That adds up to 294,890. There are more Panthers fans than panthers.  Saints: There are roughly 11,930,352 Saints fans. For this study, I've only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.  49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. "49ers" refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.  Cardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 [northern cardinals alone](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory). There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.  Rams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn't even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.  Seahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.  Bengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I'm just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I'm already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.  Browns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about [1,552,500 people](http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown) with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it's very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.  Ravens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. [There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory). There are more ravens than Ravens fans.  Steelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I'm just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren't several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.  Bills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about [3,002,475](http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william) people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we'd need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.  Dolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don't really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I'm just going to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1), where "Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast" believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.  Jets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there's no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.  Patriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A [Gallup poll from last July](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx) found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we've had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there's zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.  Colts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A [Colt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we'll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I'm just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!  Jaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.  Texans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.  Titans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.  Broncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world's 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I'm just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don't know why they wouldn't be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn't appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.  Chargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers [don't seem to have been named after an actual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years), so I'll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.  Chiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief) is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.  Raiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a "raider" isn't really an actual thing. It's pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.  **Summary**: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:  Atlanta Falcons   Arizona Cardinals   Los Angeles Rams   Baltimore Ravens   Miami Dolphins   New England Patriots   Houston Texans   Los Angeles Chargers    Make of that what you will.  **Conclusion**: Turns out that there are a lot of birds in the world. This is peak off-season. Good stuff.I love the Jaguars fans estimate you had there.I like how you can tell when OP was just getting tired of it and was thinking to himself "is karma really worth it?" This is some high-quality, high-effort offseason content.It makes me sad that there are only 2500 bengal tigers left :(I hate to break it to you, but you can save drafts on reddit. You could have typed a word-a-day if you wanted.Incredible piece of journalism. Well done.>There are more Jets fans than jets   "That's shocking considering how bad the Jets are."  -My girlfriend who I legitimately believe has never seen an entire NFL game.That conclusion is impeccable. There really ARE a lot of birds in the world.I can't wait to see this in each of the major sports subreddit I operate under the assumption that all Lions are actually Lions fans as well, so I knew my answer before reading.   ONE PRIDEThere are 100 Billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and an estimated 1 x 10^24 stars in the universe.  There are more stars than Dallas Stars fans. I like how you can see the exact second in Dolphins where OP stopped giving a shit.>Redskins: I'm not touching this one  - Every smart free agent, probably I am proud to be a team with the most controversial decisionMods can we sticky this?So you mean to tell me that there is an unknown number of dolphins living in our oceans and NO ONE is worried about this? They could stage an uprising at any moment! We could be outnumbered by the MILLIONS for all we know. [deleted]There are not enough of them to make a huge difference but Argentina has a fair number of Cowboys called 'gauchos'.This is, in my humble opinion, a high quality off-season shitpost. Well done. >There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason.       Dude.You could have milked this for way more karma by making a daily/weekly series (1/32 - Are there more bears than Bears fans?).  Thank you for not doing this.I don't think there could possibly be a more reliable source than Patricia Barquin,Dolphin Enthusiast.Raiders ARE a real thing. Think of pirates, marauders, gangsters and even military soldiers. They raid.  49ers one is pretty funny First off, this is an amazing shitpost. Secondly, I love the idea that the L.A. Chargers are named after phone and computer chargers.>fans for some reason     Fuck you, we are loyal ya jerk and we love our team > The Los Angeles Chargers don't seem to have been named after an actual thing  Kind of inaccurate. A charger, in our case, is a cavalry horse, which makes sense given the traditions it was named after.  > "I liked it because they were yelling ‚Äòcharge‚Äô and sounding the bugle at Dodgers Stadium and at USC games."  On top of this, USC's official mascot is not exactly the Trojan soldier, but the [horse](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/81/72/388172c66eb93b75ae9d81892414625f.jpg) itself on which he rides, named Traveler.  Now what kinds of horses are used as chargers? Well, in medieval times ~~(again, fitting for USC's theme here)~~, there were three types of cavalry horses (destriers, coarsers, and rounceys). Of course, those are classifications and not horse types. The typical horses used were stallions, but mares and geldings were also used by certain groups.  Cursory searches don't give me very good estimates on stallions or certain other horse types, so I just turned to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_in_the_United_States). According to that Wikipedia article:  > In 2005, there were about 9 million horses [in the United States].  That's around double the number of fans that we have, but since I really don't know how many stallions are in the world now, there may not be more chargers out there than Chargers fans.  We're also part of /r/UngulateTeams and have a horse on our old [alternate logos](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/73/79/fd/7379fda7eb114d9787b512f410f356b2.jpg), so....yeah.  EDIT: some stuff  EDIT 2: I suck at history, I guess[deleted]>Buccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to Wikipedia , the term "buccaneer" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.  LOLOLI love following the slow descent of your interest in this project down to the point of not even researching anymoreI feel like the Patriots are referencing the Patriots of the revolutionary war and not any modern lover of god and country.  Hence the logo and the dudes shooting muskets.  This one should fall in your "they all dead" category.Are there really 300 Million NFL fans though?    "Only" 27 million people watched the Conference Championship Games. That number should include people who only tuned into the game for a little bit. I wouldn't call anyone who didnt at least tune into a conference championship a true NFL fan.   The Super Bowl was even only watched by 111 million. And at least 1/2 of those people were just watching for a party or commercials. At least someone found a decent purpose for math. Do the redskinsThe most interesting part of this to me was that there are over a billion sheep.I think Buffalo got away with one here. Bill is more common than the other shortforms, and you could argue every William *is* a Bill even if that isn't the short form they typically use.I hope someone reads this and offers you a very highly payed research oriented job. Nice work. You could just say there is only one Paul Brown.  Also, you can tough Redskins. We all know what it means, regardless of whether or not we like the word. >giants are mythological creatures   I'm fucking deadYes but how many falcons are also Falcons fans? Inquisitive minds want to know.I was really hoping you did what you did with "Chargers." Immediate upvote for thatI feel like I just read one man's descent into madnessDidn't include Dorothy Mantooth or Corey Perry in the saints therefore the entire list is invalidatedJust to nitpick, doesn't the "Giants" name refer to the skyscrapers of NYC?Not too many Giants. You have  Giant Baba   Andre the Giant   The Giant (The big show)  Giant Haystacks  Giant Gonzalez   Giants winMan some of those numbers were depressing to read. Would Somali Pirates be raiders? Regarding "Browns" I think you should expand your search to include surnames in other languages, so you would have "Braun" included since it means Brown in German, and "Moreno" for Spanish, etc.  I suppose you were looking for exact terms but it might make an interesting addendumWhoa whoa whoa.  "Panthers" doesn't mean any species from the genus Panthera. It only means a black Jaguar or black Leopard.   Please reevaluate your worldwide Panther estimateHey OP, don't forget about the Military jets too. >Texans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.  Of all of the stats, this one feels the saddest. They don't have even get a quarter of the people they named the team after.For those dubbing this a shitpost, it absolutely is not. Wouldn't even be if posted in-season. Here's why:  1.) It got us thinking about animal populations in proportion to something they may actually have a stronger grasp of, in this case NFL team fan bases.  2.) It got us thinking about the relative size and scale of the different NFL fan bases.  3.) We all now now there are many, many more birds than originally thought.  4.) We were reminded of important historical fast, like that the Vikings used to exist and now they don't.  5.) We were reminded that despite the apparent billions of chargers in the world, you can never find one when you really need one.You are wrong about the Saints. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, aka the Mormons, [consider each and every one of their 15,882,417 members to be a "saint".](https://www.gotquestions.org/Latter-Day-Saints.html) This is more than your researched figure of 11,930,352 Saints fans, shifting the Saints into the "teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are" category.One shitpost to rule them allI call bullshit on there being that many Seahawks fans... at least legitimate fans. You know, ones who have owned their jersey more than 1 season, or could name 5 players on their team. For your colts one I would factor in that there are more young horses than old horses (the same can he said for almost any healthy species population). So there's almost certainly more Colts than Colts fans >there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world.  :(> Redskins: I'm not touching this one.  Pussy.  There are 1,983,745 Redskins fans. There are 2.9m Native Americans as of the 2010 census. So there are more Natives then Skins fans. As native I wanted to note that in the major metropolitan area I live in, There are more Skins fans among the Natives then most people would guess. Pretty much all the natives I know of are Skins fans. Maybe 15% are not.    Interesting that both kind of Patriots only have those numbers when they're winning...>I'm just going to use Quora, where "Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast" believes that there are well over seven million.  I think Patricia is the real hero here.I have but one upvote to give for such a useless yet incredibly informative and entertaining post that I never knew I wanted or needed.I see you went with 'meat' for packers. > Redskins: I'm not touching this one.  Good call!This just makes me sad for the state of nature conservation CHARGERS ARE NOT NAMED AFTER A WAR HORSE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK THAT  "San Diego Chargers-Barron Hilton picked the Chargers name when he purchased an AFL franchise for Los Angeles. ‚ÄúI liked it because they were yelling ‚Äòcharge‚Äô and sounding the bugle at Dodgers Stadium and at USC games.‚Äù  They were named after the "Charge!" chant in which was based on the trojan horse.  There are more LA Dodgers fans and USC fans than Chargers fans alone but there are more Chargers fans than war horses, but more phone chargers than Chargers fans.  So whatever you want to go by, the Chargers are neutral.  But the Chargers are iconic for lightning. Lightning strikes the Earth 100 per second, the same rate the Chargers lose 100 fans. It is clearly obvious the Chargers are now irrelevant as a franchise. >Redskins: I'm not touching this one.  lolMy favorite part was your sanity slowly dwindle. From the modern day prophet  69memlordharambe420 Give this man one more gold:   >Redskins: I'm not touching this one.    Bravo!Bravo. Easily the most informative thing I've read today!I didn't know I needed this in my life. Thank you. Watching OP's enthusiasm for this project diminish over time was one of the funniest things I've seen on Reddit in a while. Other highlights were the Jags fans quip and watching him get momentarily excited about the close match between Colts and Colts fans.      Also, if everyone my buddy calls "chief" when he's drunk is eligible as a chief (seems close enough to your passing quality research to me), then I think that match is a lot closer.For the Redskins, you should have done red skin potatoes, lol.Wow.Good shit opLmao fucking amazing, might wanna recheck you math on the Titans thoThis is the highest quality shit post I have ever seen.I liked how you seem to get more contemptuous to the idea of this post the further you got along - but you still followed though. How many Cardinals does the Catholic Church have Brown is an extremely popular name all over the UK. I don't know if you can scrape together an extra 2,200,000 +, but it's possible. Got to be a few dotted around the rest of the world. You just had to skimp on the raiders... Jaguars fan: "Hey, there are dozens of us! Literally dozens!"That's the longest post I've read all the way through in a long time. I loved the commentary and general loss of motivation nearing the end. In particular the Redskins comment, and the Chargers and Raiders not being named after anything. I really want to know tho, what would the answer be for the Redskins? Thanks for a great read! This literally made me geek out.  Reading your slow ascension to madness due to undergoing this project, was hilarious.I didn't know the Browns were named after somebody with the last name Brown, I always thought it was some sort of big Marmaduke type dog...> There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87.  feelsbadman[deleted]I was really hoping you'd put the Jaguars fan total at like 4. Still a great post!What I took away from this is that there are some depressingly low numbers of certain animal populations.There's a couple of us.Yeah, it's clearly at least 106, since each player has parents.There are dozens of them! Dozens!!Did his guess include players on the team and their families?That might've been the best part*"I've made a huge mistake"*I like how he went all-in at the Chargers. He saw an end in sight and rushed for it, with no fucks given.This is like the diary of a crazy person. A shitpost with research always gets an A+ from me. It's like it graduates from a shitpost to a pisspost or something. It's less offensive, less toxic, and generally more approved of.I like how as you read along you could definitely feel him slowly lose his sanity. This was way more interesting than it had any right to be this is what happens when your adderall was supposed to wear off an hour ago. quality shit posting at its finest. this is why we F5Agreed.  The travesty though is that this post has less than 500 upvotes after two hours.  For shame r/NFL!T.J.

That's what happens when you destroy their habitat and tell everyone it's okay to hunt them. Sorry, I know it's football but I'm going to college for environmental science so it hits me hard that some of the most beautiful creatures on earth are so close to extinction because of us, humans.And most of them are in Texas. That's a double whammy of suck. I believe the population is growing, so there's that at least.Oh.> you can save drafts on reddit  Wha?

Have to give her credit for knowing the answer anyway. That's some women's intuition.Irrelevant but I need to share it with someone that may appreciate the absurdity:   Awhile ago, i had a recurring dream every night for a week where the jets won the super bowl.

Wasn't really disappointed. I didn't know this was still a roast thread.If you were feeling up for it, you could compare to the annual redskin potato harvestRedskins are a variety of potato, of which there are probably just goddamn billions, so there are most definitely more Redskin potatoes than Redskins fans.smh, everyone in here automatically assuming OP was referring to the number of Native Americans instead of the global potato countEagles fans channel their lack of super bowl wins into savage roasts I vote every colts fan gets a colt of their very own, raise it, and then when it gets too old send it to denver ,as is tradition.TO THE MEGATHREADNah they'll just peace out and fly into space.

My driving school teacher called me crazy for hating dolphins.I didn't realize this but now I'm extremely hardThe Seahawks are a regional team. When people talk about all the bandwagon Seahawk fans, they forget to mention 1 thing. If you like NFL football in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska and of course Washington, you're most likely a Seahawks fan or grew up in a house of Seahawks fans.   I guess its just more fun to be like "Her der Seahawks fans are 12 year old bandwagon fans!" Same reaction I had to seeing the 12 million saints fans! We out here!I'm in favor of playing as the Dallas GauchosAre there still some Mexican vaqueros?Obviously Stockmen in Australia, as well.And students at UC Davis are also gauchos and if you count all the alumni... I'm not gonna do the math but it should be close maybe.     Edit: it's UCSB I thought the giants referred to the skyscrapers in New York? This is the kind of off-season content that keeps me coming back to sports subsThis was the best partYou have a reason, don't you?That would be the slideshow article of Reddit posts.Corporate raids. Air raids. Immigration raids. Commando raids. Drug raids. Tomb raiders. Raiding the refrigerator. Raiding the cookie jar. Panty raids.  Everyone is a Raider.I mean what about all the people who do raids on MMOs like WoW. Thats gotta be a bigger numberRaiders gonna raid.OaklandersVikings too. Us long-dead professions out hereYou guys are definitely loyal, no doubt about that. gotta do something when the cavs aren't playing...Fuck yeah!Honestly I saw that and considered looking into it but the Chargers were so late into this that I just no longer cared.Alternatively: Medieval times were centuries ago, and their charger horses are all dead.  There are definitely more Charger fans than chargers.I had NO idea horses had anything to do with you guys, that's an interesting tidbit of knowledgeYeah, no way there are more cavalry-quality horses around than chargers fans.If you asked me "which would win in a fight? All the cardinals in the world or all the lions in the world? "I certainly would have said lions. But I can't imagine each lion would be able to take down 6,000 cardinals. It was actually pretty comical haha. It made the list better.I thought their mascot was Elvis. You can be patriotic and secular. [They're definitely not all dead](http://i.imgur.com/2OETRVf.jpg)Like I said, feel free to scale the numbers as befits your definition. I'm pretty sure that all of the numbers that I found just include everyone who self-identifies as a fan.I'm a royals fan but if they aren't in the playoffs I'm not watching any playoff baseball. Does that 27 million figure include people who watched it in group settings? (Parties, bars, casinos etc.)I'm a fan of my team, why would I watch the Patriots win another AFC Championship?I thought there was only about 300 people in the US total. Surely all of them are not NFL fans, maybe like 1/3 at most. I really doubt there's twice as many NFL fans in the rest of the world as there is here.Also, there's no way there are more Saints fans than Giants fans.TIL I'm not a fan because I can't watch some games live because they occur at 3AM before a workday.>Packers fan  >Thinks math is dumb I tell students that eventually math is going to kill you. The best way to defend yourself is more math. Or, you can pay for someone to math for you. There are roughly 5,840,081 Redskins fans. Redskin is a derogatory term for native Americans. According to the 2010 US census, 2.9 million people self identified as an "American Indian/Alaska Native", however the actual number of native Americans is much lower because marking that selection entitles students to preferential treatment from American universities.  There are more redskins fans than redskins.There are countries with more sheep than people.Maybe if the Bills were in the NFC East instead of the AFC East I would have gotten to them at a point where I still had the energy to figure this out. Also, as a bonus, it would make their divisional games so much more fun.Redskin potatoes!In that case, I would guess that it's very likely there are more fans.Based on that wikipedia article I'm gonna guess there are like 25 million falcons in the world.  Assuming they follow global human demographics, roughly 1 in 1000 of them will be Falcons fans.  This means there are roughly 25 thousand falcon Falcons fans.No, 'cause then they'd never let the Jets touch them.They were named after the New York baseball Giants, which was a common thing for football teams to do in the early days of pro football. I've heard two versions of how the baseball got their name. There's the skyscraper theory, and an apocryphal story about how their manager came into the clubhouse after a well-played game and shouted, "My big fellows! My giants!" They adopted the Giants name in 1885, which was around the time the first skyscrapers were being built, and I guess also a time when a manager might actually say something like "My big fellows! My giants!" and have it be a thing that people like enough to name a team after it. (The were called the Gothams prior to that, btw)Yes, but there's still more fans than skyscrapers, even if you include the whole world.Maybe you could count the 25 San Francisco Giants.I never made that connection with Moreno. Knowshon Brown!Exactly, Panthers aren't a dime a dozen creature like some dirty bird. Right, but he's saying that even with the most generous definition, there are certainly more Panthers fans than Panthers. Florida Panthers and Texas Panthers are both brown. Not all panthers are black.Fun fact: Jaguars used to range from western Lousisana/Arkansas to Southern California (historic northern limits seem to be contested).  They have, however, never ranged into florida. Y'all should have been named sometthing else damnitThere's no way there are 25M Cowboys fans and only 2M Redskins fans. Redskins are routinely in contention with Cowboys and Patriots for most valuable NFL franchise.[Is this you?](http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/273/752/jags1_crop_north.png?1366732519&w=630&h=420)I've had a lot of people tell me I'm the first Jags fan they've met, and I live in the SouthI thought 87 was a bit high, tbhDozens, in fact.Literally dozensSome have died of shame though.I'm sure poppa Bortles still reps a UCF hat.Not every parent roots for the team their child plays for.

There are maybe another 1000-2000 tigers of the other various subspecies. It's still a sadly small number of animals though :(No need to be sorry mate. Humans are dicks to animals, you are rightThat is a huge part of the problem, but it leads to the next problem which is just as bad, genetic bottleneck. We're now having to try to impregnate Tigers artificially from some other Tiger that is as far away from each others bloodlines as possible, which is difficult.    Roughly the same thing is happening for Cheetahs as well, though not as much to do with human influence, but its still a huge problem for the species. You've never encountered one in the wild.

Most bengal tigers are in Texas???You could have also just written it in a word doc and posted it whenever you were ready unless you are often switching between computers.So exhausted he can only type a 2 letter reply.

If anyone else wants to do those, go for it, I'm not claiming anything It would be much harder. The NFL gifted you a significant number of animals, and it's the only league where every team name is a plural. Look at the NBA, for example. How would you count how many Magic, Heat, Thunder or Jazz there are?You'll have to wait for the offseason, r/baseball is very strict about not having shitposts (even of this high of quality).Definitely the all star break. We can do it during one of the 27 pitching changes. A group of self-hating lions is known as a Shame.

Edit: I get it, the Browns play like shit and look like shit.It's our year this yearI'm not a Cavs fan and I've only been to Cleveland once, common misconception that all Browns fans are from Cleveland. I'm actually from Maryland and live near Cincy. The Browns surprisingly have one of the largest world wide fan bases. I understand why some outsiders might think of it this way, but in reality the Cavs are what we do when the Browns aren't playing.   You think the Cavs celebration was big? Just wait for a Browns super bowl. Lol perfectly understandable. You wrote this in one go, I'd be sick of it by the end too.Much like the San Diego fan base :/I thought you were going to go with dodge chargers, and when you said you and several people you know owned several charges I was a bit puzzledRIP horsieLol the general perception, thanks to the uniform design, is that we're nothing but an electricity-related team, which brings up memes like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8f/dc/3c/8fdc3c3340f7f983db6854a0cca05889.jpg).

I showed one alternate shield logo, but [this shield](http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/99/3071/full/hinooehlb07wrotq26b2pvpey.gif) was pretty much our primary logo back in the day. The bugle sound and "Charge!" chants when we get the ball are references to cavalry charges and were probably taken straight from USC. We also [made cannons trendy](http://www.trbimg.com/img-58dd6ef5/turbine/sd-sp-cannon-chargers-20170327) before the Bucs put a boat in their stadium. It fired after we scored too.

One of the bigger travesties of the team moving to LA is the cannon won't be going with the team, not because the operator (that gentleman in the first picture) doesn't want to, its because he really can't make that drive up there every home game now, its too far.Probably not, but hey, fun to think about.He's dead too. I just checked and Fox News says "no". Sorry.If you're unaware of the concept of "costume" Halloween must be fucking lit for you!If someone asks, I say I am a Brewers fan, but I haven't watched a complete baseball game in probably 15 years.Yeah my friend is like that with the Lions. Die hard Lions fan, but doesn't watch any regular seasons games not involving the Lions and doesn't bother watching playoff games if they don't involve the Lions.But that's baseball. At the end of football season I want to watch every game because I don't want football to be over. Baseball has so many damn games that I don't give a shit anymore come playoff time unless my team is in it. 300 people you say? Hmmm... I can't think of a reason why I should be surprisedOr you could be paid money to math for others. - Recent accounting grad [deleted][deleted]That's only counting in the US, surely once you take Canada and South+Central America into account there are more?Wake upThere are orders of magnitude more redskin potatoes than fans of the Washington, DC football team.Depends on how you define it.  The early explorers would have included indigenous peoples south of the border and north as well as those in the US.  In the US, there are 5.4 million total American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  Toss in a bunch more from Canada/Mexico/Caribbean/maybe even South America and you end up with far more than we have Redskins fans.  On the other hand, the term originally comes from tribes in the Mississippi river area of the country (not precisely sure where on the river) in their original dealings with French explorers and traders (many of these French would eventually settle in the Louisiana area and basically create cajun country), so really would only apply to Indians in what is now the US, which would mean more fans than Indians.Do you think non-Falcon fan Falcons get shit from Falcon Falcons fans for not supporting their team?Wow.

That was one of my high school history teachers near StL.My best friend is a Jags fan (we're from Jersey) and when we went to Florida for spring break he saw a lone MJD jersey and it was the first time he saw another fan in his lifeIf it makes you feel any better, I live in Jacksonville and I've had people *laugh* at my Jags shirt.I've met 2 total outside of Florida.  1 when I lived in VA (but he was from Florida), and one in the Navy (he was from Ohio).  And I'm from CA, definitely never seen another Jags fan all the way out here.I went to the preseason game against the Jags where Vick debuted for us. I think I only saw one person in a jags jersey there, but he was miraculously as drunk as the rest of his section. There may be few of you, but y'all are legendary.Ohio has a silly amount of Jags fans for some reason. Basically you started when the browns bolted, so a non negligible number took up the teal and gold here.I'm a Jags fan in Indianapolis....we're in multiple places.I have never been in this subreddit before but you guys are Cold.

This was a SEPTA train. SEPTA is inherently incapable of being early.   This particular train line is late to the point where I assume it's going to be late, adjust what time I get to the station accordingly, and always take a train that gets in an hour before I need to be somewhere just in case.   And on this day that goddamn train pulled up 2 minutes before its arrival time. I actually assumed it was the train before it running really late. Nope.

It does seem odd that the NBA would come up with a name for a new team that is the same name of arguably its biggest star at the time, especially since the word itself is more of an abstract concept.

We unofficially adopted the bulldog due to our fan section going by the moniker of the ["Dawg Pound"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawg_Pound) dating back to the 80s (when we actually played well).

I've been to Cleveland none times, but I'm an ex-Chargers fan/native San Diegan. I like to drink (heavily) and many of my friends are Browns fans. Also I figure some of you, at least, can probably feel my pain.I just remember from the offseason "Europeans/non-Americans of r/nfl, how did you choose a team to support?" posts that there were a lot of Browns fans who chose the Browns because they didn't want to get accused of bandwagoning.Spanos family: what's tradition?That shield is awesome, and should absolutely be the logo. Kinda of reminds me of the Aussie term for veterans, which was "Digger", and it's a compliment or something you'd call someone when they've done good. I'm watching MIB right now.  "Elvis is not dead. He just went home."I'm kind of the same with the Spurs. Alhough I will watch a few games a year, I never really watch them in their entirety.Same for me and basketball- I haven't watched a sonics game in *ages*Dude, if you're not a baseball fan just admit it.  Coming up with imaginary teams to "root" for just makes you look sillyI don't know, I bleed green and gold and follow the Packers closely but it's not guaranteed I'm watching the playoffs if they are not in it. I just used the same method as OP it's listed in the postNot as depressing as 5.8 million redskin fans.Genocide is usually pretty depressing.Don't worry, most scholars think there were only about 50 million before we arrived, so we just cut it down by about 47 million (or 94%)They never called those people Redskins. I'm speaking as the latest in a long line of Redskins.You could probably say there's more fans on Redskin Potatoes than the football team. Not really "fans" if you're getting paid to be there.

That's like meeting a unicorn I saw a guy in New York in a Jags shirt and said Go Jags to him. He looked up at me and didn't say anything back.  That's the only Jags fan I've met outside of Florida. You should see the Eagles fans during the roast threads. i was thinking lightning strikes per annum. There's gotta be a stat for that, right?The Offseason Post should be a newspaper style compilation of all the most ridiculous stuff from the offseason That sounds like the name of town. Maybe in Louisiana?Haha not that easy!A season I'll never forget :')Yeah but we could breed bison for milk (Some people do) and meat, and they could be domesticated. Big cats, not so much. So it was a little easier to rehabilitate the Bison than it is for cats.    Plus they're just easier to get them to fuck. Have some bison over there that need to fuck some ones over here? Herd them. Can't really herd cats, in fact, I think there's a saying about it. I knew a guy who was a zoology PhD student doing research for a book on the black market rare animal trade in Texas and it was insane. One guy with a ranch full of endangered species let him come and take a tour as long as he didn't give away any names or locations. He said the market for tigers had crashed after a few news stories about people getting mauled by them, but he was betting big on penguins being the next hot item.That's fucked up.Yeah, but then someone would have hacked his cloud and posted it before he could, thereby stealing all of his sweet, sweet karma. That's true, he could have also just written it in google docs or dropbox or something like that.You can.Well the average cardinal only weights 1.5 oz, but bears range from 240 - ~1000 lbs.

According to this [source](https://www.livescience.com/14714-lightning-prone-states-110620.html), there are approximately 1,017,989 lightning strikes per year in Oklahoma (I know, the team specifically refers to Oklahoma City, but I fear I can't find an answer or care to for just the city.) To keep it fair, the Thunder have only been around since 2008, and in assuming all lightning produces thunder because I'm not a fucking meteorologist, we will estimate 9 years of thundering. That's 9,161,901 thunders in Oklahoma.  In conclusion, there are more thunders in Oklahoma than there are Seattle Supersonics fans because lol.Or how about "wild" and "devils"  1.416833(85) x 10^^32 Kelvin degrees, and at temperatures above it, the laws of physics just cease to exist.   There are more Heat than heat fans. Too many, this time of yearMore every year, it seems Many thaums.Same for the Duke Blue Devils.But "redskins" refers specifically to North American tribes and the situation of the native populations in South America is completely different from that of us up north so this is a gross overestimate.Lulz 69Dallas MadrechingadorsDont make me throw you off the ledge MufasaTo be honest, I mostly intend to watch college football and let Goodell and Spanos enjoy having the team I rooted for nearly three decades, in good times and bad, exist in a city that doesn't care about them.I have some old navy buddies in Cleveland so I have no shortage of couches to crash on - one of these days soon I think.If you want to feel worse, some scholars estimate pre-columbus native american populations at around 100 millionNot to derail this further, but if this relatively new to you (at least the scale of it all), just remember it didn't stop at genocide, and this wasn't all part of a bygone era in US history.  [Here's a great timeline/brief recap of some of the institutions levied against Native Americans and the effects of these actions.](https://historyscoop.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/indian_history-timeline.pdf)  [There were full on erasure efforts to extinguish the remaining survivors' cultures:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools) *Children were typically immersed in European-American culture through appearance changes with haircuts, were forbidden to speak their native languages, and traditional names were replaced by new European-American names (to both "civilize" and "Christianize"). The experience of the schools was often harsh, especially for the younger children who were forcibly separated from their families. In numerous ways, they were encouraged or forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures. Investigations of the later twentieth century have revealed many documented cases of sexual, manual, physical and mental abuse occurring at these schools.*  [Even in the 1960s, they were continuing to attempt to eradicate their identity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_termination_policy)  And just my two cents here (and I'm Mexican American so), but this is **exactly** why I am so fed up with people defending the name Redskins and its modern usage. This isn't over, and the government to this day is destroying the original settlers of this continent. It's utterly disgusting.If you want to be especially sad go read some history about the subject, like the trail of tears.  Really uplifting stuff. Well that's a blanket statement. ~~Me... :(~~I mean, dominatrixes have a clientele, makes sense that the Jags do too.

Thats a lot of band wagons lolBut there are more illegitimate children of Shawn Kemp than there are Oklahoma Thunders fans.That's temperature, not heat.Yeah those naturally occurring blue devils are everywhere. Unlike the division.The origin of the term is unknown, even though in this case it clearly refers to North American natives. "Redskins" is also how we sometimes refer to our natives in Brazil (peles-vermelhas).We found Gronk's Reddit account!niceI don't even speak Spanish, but I know "mother fucker" when I see it.Some fringe theories.

I'm calling bs on that estimate. >And just my two cents here (and I'm Mexican American so), but this is **exactly** why I am so fed up with people defending the name Redskins and its modern usage. This isn't over, and the government to this day is destroying the original settlers of this continent. It's utterly disgusting.  Not trying to start an argument, because I definitely get why even non-Native Americans would be upset over that name, it just doesn't have any weight with me.  I'm half Cherokee.  I never lived on a reservation, but I grew up in an area heavy with Indians (I know we aren't called that mostly anymore, partly because of confusion, but it's what we called each other).  I did the club thing, the meetings, learning the traditions, attending conferences, etc. and I've only ever known the term redskin to mean the football team.  Hell, in NC, there were/are tons of Native Americans who support the Redskins.  This obviously doesn't make it ok, but that's my experience with the word.  If someone was trying to be offensive and called me a redskin, I'd probably just laugh and say that I'm a Panthers fan.  Savage is a much nastier term, IMO.  I could go on and on about the subjugation of Native Americans (fuck Columbus!).  Many people don't even care because, if they do know a Native American, they're like 1/32nd Native on their mother's side and don't know much of the culture or history.  It's not their fault.  Hell, outside of the gas pipeline thing, you don't even really hear much advocacy for Native Americans on national news and you have to actively search for it.  Throw 'em on a reservation, give them a casino, and go on about your day.  All that said, I just can't find it in me to be offended by the Redskins' name, even though other Natives may.Yup. There's even a colony down in Oamaru, and that's just a pit-stop between Christchurch and Dunedin.deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6819  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/62502)AND they need two - One for each foot (or sometimes 1 or 0) Heat is the amount of energy flowing from one body of matter to another spontaneously due to their temperature difference.   Doesn't matter where you put that kind of temperature, the amount of heat transfer to anything nearby would be insane.    That's sort of like dropping a rock to measure the impact and when I start to write down the rock's weight you go "That's gravity, not weight." The origin of the term in North America was to depict a bloody Native skin that the US government paid a bounty for during their attempt at genocide and settlement. The origin of the term is known and the meaning is unmistaken. Yeah Gronk probably is a Packers fan.It's hard to guess because of no written histories and no structures that stand the test of time, but accounts of sailors and what they saw makes people believe there were a ton more native Americans living in the Americas before, then small pox wiped everyone out>The origin of the term in North America was to depict a bloody Native skin that the US government paid a bounty for during their attempt at genocide and settlement. The origin of the term is known and the meaning is unmistaken.    This assertion is patently false (and very much mistaken). I'm not advocating the use of "redskin" as either a convention or an NFL team, but the term was around and being used to describe American aboriginals long before 'scalping' or 'bounty scalping' came into common parlance.  The idea that the term has anything to do with bounties, war, or injurious blood seems to have arisen in the 1970s and has little support in the scholastic community.

Duh, he's still playing the long con probably?

r/nfl, This is the one. The 2008 Lions champagne will go unpopped this year.  I was waiting all season to find that ‚Äúdefining moment‚Äù of 0-16. I think Coleman dropping a wide open pass summed it up perfectly Browns fans: my username is for sale!They‚Äôve won three games since September of 2015. That‚Äôs just mind bogglingrip corey colemanBoth the 2008 Lions and 2017 Browns went 4-0 in the preseasonHue Jackson said they wouldnt go 1-15 again. He was definitely correct thereWelcome to the club brothers.[deleted]Well, it doesn't get worse than this at least.  Edit: Quit giving me worse scenarios you dicksBrowns  * 2015: 3-13 * 2016: 1-15 * 2017: 0-16 * 2018: Going for negative wins somehowhttps://i.imgur.com/UPbjShU.jpgC**LLLLLLLL**eve**LLLLLLLL**and Brons That'll do Browns, that'll do.Unfade Cleveland's flair.

Cleveland Frowns :(The lesson to learn from this is never go 4-0 in Pre Season.My dad has been a fan for 40+ years. Why was I born into this?#FIRE HUE JACKSONBest 0-16 team ever don‚Äôt @ meCorey Coleman is a Brown for life.Can we unfade them please?  Or give them some kind of special flair, like their logo in a Dumpster?This hurts Cleveland‚Äôs chances of winning the super bowl doesn‚Äôt it?I feel so bad for corey Coleman [I'll be wearing this to the parade!](https://images.halloweencostumes.com/blog/images/815/4132-1/game-of-thrones-shame-nun-costumejpg.jpg)Lions fan here.  0-16 doesn't have to define you and there is hope.  Let it make your fan base stronger, and your players tougher.I was one in our sub who wanted you guys to avoid 0-16 so bad, but history is made.  While the jokes will be plenty, and the memory will always be there know two things:  1. You never have to say you're the only team to go 0-16 (like we have endured the last decade)  2. You will never have a worse record!  Chin up Browns fans.  After playing you guys you have a young team full of potential.  After our 0-16 we got our lord and Savior Stafford and since then it has only gone up and we are finally a team consistently competitive.  I mean shit we had a winning season and STILL may be firing our HC.  Itll take time but I see a solid future for you guys.  Welcome to the clubWe can‚Äôt even be the best at losing :(At least they get the parade.  Need a commemorative DVDThe end of an errorI sat in the stands for every home game during the 0-16 season. I never in my life thought I would see another team go winless.   Un-fucking-believable. Going 0-16 and retaining the coach who not only has a 1-31 record with the team but also throws players under the bus truly makes me question my fandom. I could take one of these factors but not all of them combined.First, I'd like to thank God for making this possible...Bah Gawd, they actually did it.You're the lucky winner of the "Browns finish 0-16" posts. Congrats.One of us, one of us...Sad I thought we‚Äôd go at least 5-11  And we had 3 winnable games too: Steelers twice and the PackersDeshone Kizer in Coleman's ear telling him shhhhh bby, it's okay. Time to set Hue adrift on a dinghy on Lake Erie.That moment when your team name has more W's than your season.If you‚Äôre one of the people out there that is planning a parade for 0-16, I will fight you. Come down and see me right now, I‚Äôm at Buffalo Wild Wings. You‚Äôre going to celebrate my misery for four months?  That is the loser-est of all loser moves I‚Äôve ever heard in my life. My God, man. Have some pride in yourself. Oh look, Cleveland‚Äôs throwing a parade because they lot every game of the season. How stupid is that? How dumb is that? Who thinks that‚Äôs a good idea? I don‚Äôt want you on my team. I want winners‚Ä¶  If you are one of the people planning that parade, you better stay the hell away from me, my show, and my family, ‚Äôcause I‚Äôll fight you. I can‚Äôt fight. I‚Äôm old, but I‚Äôll give you 10 seconds of fury. That‚Äôs all I got. After that, you can kick my butt.  I will do everything in my power to stop that. I will talk to Senator Sherrod Brown, Mayor Frank Jackson. I‚Äôll talk to everyone I can. I swear to god‚Ä¶ I will mow you down under my tires. I promise that. If you have that parade, it‚Äôs going to end ugly‚Ä¶  I know billionaires, senators, mayors, governors. That is going to go away, mark my words. It ain‚Äôt going to happen on my watch, I promise you that.I didn't honestly think it would happen.  Year after year, it's always a scare. But even the most awful teams in history (2009 Rams, 2011 Colts, **2015 Browns**) managed a win or two.  It seemed that only the Lions could possibly have been so fucking cursed.  But here we are.  Sorry Cleveland.  But I'd be lying if I said I weren't relieved.  I just wish it could be a team that I hated, or didn't give a shit about.  Welcome to the club friends. There‚Äôs cold beer in the fridge. Let me know if you need anything. 30 for 30: The Drive, The Fumble, and The Drop.  What if I told you, just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it could.

We all knew it was coming since like week 81-31 in two years. Ouch. Damn, I‚Äôve built this moment up in my head so much it can never live up to my imagination. There were more attempts at a karma grab for this than there were Browns winsWE'RE FREE!!! Aye, ill drink to that One of the worst parts about this (besides the soul crushing misery) is that we did it in the social media boom so now every asshole in the world gets to remind me how embarrassed I should be and how pitiful my team is.   I chose the worst possible time to get into Reddit.WE DID IT!!! WE FOUND THE MOD-APPROVED BROWNS THREAD THEY DID IT!!Hue Jackson is 1-31 as Browns Head Coach and not being on the hot seat for Browns executives is insane.  Congratulations to the Cleveland Browns on their perfect season!The Browns going 0-16 won me ¬£3,650I don‚Äôt even feel good about this win. This is like if LeBron went to visit the children‚Äôs hospital and then proceeded to dunk all over the kids. It‚Äôs just wrong Definitely the saddest ending to a game I‚Äôve ever seen. Imagine escaping a sack and then having your receiver drop a pass. Just gotta get better as a player and as a team.WE USED TO BE SPECIAL :-(0-27 here we come FeelsBadManhttps://i.redd.it/xx15qygvpb701.jpgThe win slipped through their hands.Let the parade commence!So this is the one we're keeping?  God damn this subs new was a shit show for a bit there.So is there gonna be a r/NFL meet up at the parade? We all know this is going to be a circlejerk thread of memes and making fun of the Browns. And they do deserve it cause this team has been a joke all season.  Having said that: I don‚Äôt feel right making fun of anyone right now. I genuinely feel bad for all Cleveland fans. They‚Äôve been a tire fire for years now and this just is more fuel. They deserve better than this. Lebron saved the Cavs after decades of shit; but I can‚Äôt see anyone that could save them.  I hope everyone though tries to stay polite with their ribbing.Fold the Browns.  Don't give me that "b-b-but relocation" shit, rebuilding doesn't take 20 years lmao.God hates ClevelandJosh Gordon died and was resurrected for thisKizer would of had the first if he ran I feel bad for Browns fans. One of the best fanbases in the league, and they get shit on constantly by mismanagement. So what day is the support group? I really didn't believe it would happen. That drop was the Browns way to lose.3.12% win percentage under Hue. JesusNo one is happier than the members of the 2008 Detroit Lions.I still think they could beat Green Bay.Welcome to the club my friends, at least we have the distinction of being undefeated in the preseason for our sweet 0-16‚Äôs.It's okay Brown bros. You guys are way better than your record, and you have a lot of draft picks. I think next year, with the right quarterback under center, you guys can easily get 6 or 7 wins. You guys are gonna be real sp00ky, mark my words. Kizer's nfl career comes to an end They all drank the bleach together.RIP the one special thing the Lions have done.They'll be popping champagne in the streets of Cleveland for that 0-16 parade thoughThis Ohio Michigan football rivalry is getting out of hand. This years Orlovsky play...That was the "Safety Dan" of the Browns' season, for sure Dude looked hella crushed on the sideline. Eh, I think it may have been the blocked punt in the 1st quarter of their season opener. Just set the tone for the rest of the season quite wellKudos to them for putting up a fight, but I've never seen a team try so hard to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot with turnovers, penalties, and concentration lapses..Anyone have the replay? I thought it was the Kizer pick in OT vs the Packers.  The drop certainly fits in well though.Their front office fucking up a phone call to get a backup QB was a colossal fuck-up, the Brownsiest thing We've got plenty of depressing usernames already!3 Star Wars movies have been released since then too lolAnd I thought we were badJohnny Manziel was their quarterback three Cleveland Browns wins ago4-49 in our last 53, and one of those wins was on a blocked field goal.Johnny Manziel has 2 of the last 4 wins. Even more mind-boggling is the fact that we've *won* 38 games in the last 10 years. I just don't understand at this point how teams go about winning *1* game over any stretch of time, let alone 38 of them.  No matter how far you think you've fallen, you can always fall farther. In our case, it's the fact that the coach who just went 1-31 is still our coach.Broken hands now a broken heartWhen he was sitting on the bench at the end he looked completely shell shocked.When we look back at this team for the decades to come it‚Äôs that fucking playGenuinely feel bad for him. Hard to come back from thatOne split second lapse in concentration has guaranteed that Coleman play will be on every television feature on bad teams for decadesThat drop is the perfect metaphor for the Browns [deleted]He wanted that parade.Anyone else think Kizer should have just run for it?He'll remember that foreverTIL that 0-16 teams are 8-0 in preseason games.Teams are going to start throwing preseason games on purposeThey also both never got shut out.TIL there were [Preason Champ shirts made](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-browns-do-something-they-hadnt-done-in-31-years-and-fans-are-celebrating/)  Max Cringe.Kinda like Jeff Fisher in 2016 "I'm not going 7-9".

All they have to do now is draft a stud qb, like josh rosen.Hello brothers :)Brons is correct Again Lebron is the only saving factor of the city nowadays (not like Atlanta is any better lol)thanks for winning today, it helps ease the pain a lot.Kinda like when a pawn makes it all the way to the other end of the board, but the opposite of thatIt does not.100%.  Cleveland gave 2017 Lions a scare. 2008 Lions were way worse on all sides of the ball.On top of our incompetency and roster holes, we've had shit luck too. The team is bad, the coaching is bad and ffs the blind squirrel doesn't always find a nut.Yes. I say yesOnly Hue could take this roster and go 0-16The 2017 Browns couldn't even beat the 2017 Browns. That is disrespectful to the 2008 Lions to even ask thatThe '08 Lions were unfathomably bad.  The Browns were outscored by 176 points this year. The Lions were -249 that year. I‚Äôm so excited to see this come to fruition I'm gonna goBREAK OUT THE PBRGonna be dripping in meme potential Give the man some credit. He's 1 and 31. Not like he's sporting something ridiculous like 0-32.I can't imagine giving them a cent, were I fan, if Hue is allowed in the fucking building tomorrow. You don't go 0-16 without coaching being a major issue, and somehow he's trending down from 1-15. Shouldn't have been allowed on the plane home.Because Jimmy Haslam doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about winning.

B. downvote in hopes that he‚Äôs fired so Mike Brown doesn‚Äôt trade a pick for him I will fight you@Or he'll go to the patriots after his rookie contract is up and have a bunch of success.

That ball is caught 98 times out of 100 and they gain a bunch more yards. He would have also had the first if Coleman didn't drop a wide open perfect pass.I am not here to say Kizer is a star QB but he made the right choice there.and 90% of the NFL's fansIs it time to change your flair, even if ceremoniously?https://i.imgur.com/DAI0KYM.gifWe also retire great players early Hey, we did a special thing this year too. We played a game in Lambeau and didn't punt the entire game. We're the first visiting team to ever do that.But what about the special things the Browns and Lions have done together!  * only original charter teams to not play in the Superbowl * drove their GOAT running backs into early retirement  * wasted generational talents in Joe Thomas and Calvin Johnson * and finally, went 0 - 16  eskimo brothers in the worst sense Actually, my favorite Lions play from that year was when they got a delay of game penalty COMING OUT OF A TIMEOUT. Absolute masterpiece of a fuck up.This years Orlovsky play is the interception against the packers in OT  One of the worst plays i've ever seen : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmpIl54vWW0That play keeps getting referenced but never gets linked.  [Lemme help out with that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0OkR986LL4)The Vikings won that game by 2 points. Ouch.Endzones should be 11 yards deephe ded. I believe it was on the very first drive.I would say the 2017 Browns *tried* a lot harder than the 2008 Lions. The Lions that year just gave up after the 10th or 12th loss. I remember holding on to hope that they would muster a victory in the schedule and (if memory serves) once they hit 0-14 to tie the Bucs, I knew they weren't winning the last two which were Green Bay and New Orleans.   The locker room in that season fascinates me. I wish Hard Knocks had Detroit that year so we could have seen more about what the fuck happened off the field. The Browns, as far as I can tell, simply couldn't hold opposing offenses back and never got their own offense rolling. If they mentally gave up like the old Lions team, then I didn't see it. They really seemed like they wanted it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXtbRzjA28 I'm convinced that was intentional and the sole reason sashi got fired Get u/no32 in hereHiI'm not gonna lie I absolutely love your username and you've had it for 6 years.

Lucky for you the browns are a thingbless your heart That‚Äôs an insult to broken hands tbhMaybe his mom can help him outhttps://i.imgur.com/4v1DUXp.jpgWhich is funny because there are numerous people more responsible... Sucks for him.That play will define this season in the way that Orlovsky's safety defines the 08 season.The Browns very own Safety Danman i like him too, everybody has a drop once in a while but jeeeeeeez that was badLots of respect for Kizer sitting and talking with him afterwards though, takes a lot of leadership for a rookie to do that.Anyone got a link???What do they do, go down the Cavs victory route backwards?He looked up and saw Coleman standing there in the middle of nowhere with not a Steeler within 1 billion yards. Nah he should have thrown it. He just shouldn‚Äôt have hit him right in the face I guessI'm not going to question it. He had an easy throw to a wide open receiver. No. He had a wide open WR who is paid millions of dollars to not only catch that easy ball but also be athletic enough to potentially do something special after the coach too.  In no world should Kizer have run that ball when we had a WR that open and got the ball there that well.They have also never lost a playoff gameThe real TIL is always in the comments Every team does this already. Why do you think they keep putting in guys lower and lower on the depth chart? That is so frickin weirdWow even we did that twice this yearTechnically correct. The best kind of correct.  Thank God for McBae.One of you would miss the connection and drop the other. üéµStill Cleveland, Yeah!üé∂*Our main export is crippling depression*Their economy was based on LeBron James, then it wasn't, and now it is again. Bruh, you made my day"We're not detroit" doesn't work anymore lol See a river that catches on fireLook on the bright side They'd expand to 17 games. The tiebreakers are easier to figure out when there aren't several 8-8 teams.Hes gonna jump in lake erieFor reasons that escape me.Next season the browns are going -1-17Browns fans everywhere ponder the unlikely but theoretically possible future loss of still more hope.I watched the game in silence except for the very audible sound of my heartbreaking and yelling no as I saw Coleman drop that pass. https://local.theonion.com/man-who-thought-hed-lost-all-hope-loses-last-additional-1819565674*Super Bowl LVIII champion St. Louis Browns*Get involved in a tampering scandal that also has the NFL forfeit your #1 pick as well.I Feel Like It Would Be Worse Winning all preseason games.

Man this season sucked. Right.  Like if the pawn had a clear path to the other side of the board, and if you moved him forward it'd turn to a queen and you'd win, but instead as you moved the pawn you dropped it out of your hand and onto the floor, and you lost on time because all the years spent supporting the Browns has led to over-eating, and you couldn't really bend over the whole way to pick the pawn up.When a pawn makes it to the other side and then becomes a pawn.The 2008 lions had Calvin Johnson and Jason Hanson. That's it. I fear another Cleveland fan will eat poop again. I hope ABC covers it like ThanksgivingMe too! I hope it's televised, or at least streamed. I'll watch the shit out of it. Wear a Ravens jersey and just hope you don't get lynched.THAT'S where you gotta draw the lineHe's 9 and 39. He somehow went 8-8 on the Raiders in 2011. We had major coaching issues last year and still managed 4 wins. Something has to be seriously fucked up from top to bottom to go 0-16.hey he couldve went 0-32 so its not that bad when you think about itRecord isn't always representative of how had a coach someone is. He went 8-8 in Oakland and was pretty bad there too. We want to rub it in, not drive them to drowning in Lake ErieLol like Hue Jackson could beat the fourth* best team in college footballBama doesnt need the cupcake  https://twitter.com/Steelersdepot/status/947574199748501504  There's a twitter videoDropped a wide open catch on 4th and 2 with just under 2 minutes left.Dropped a 4th down conversion in the redzone.4th and 2 down 2 on the Steelers 25 or so and he dropped the pass to convert 4th down. Kizer some how avoids the sack and throws it to a wide open Coleman for a first down, and he doesn‚Äôt catch it lol. This was on the stealers 30yd line with 1:30 leftOn 4th down he dropped a first down pass right in his hands.More like üòÅüòÇüòîüî´I seriously thought the Browns were going to get their first win vs us. We don't seem to be too into winning this season. As is traditionhttp://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=18257967Tony Rizzo. Annoying Cleveland ESPN radio guy.[55-3?

He has his faults but he should not be blamed for that play. I‚Äôm OGnever forget *brutal*I see Nathan Explosion, I upvote. We are mostly water. Bleach is mostly water. Therefore, we are bleach.That hurts worseHave to go back a ways, but Cleveland did retire an all-time great RB at 29. what an appropriate username!Was that today or the other one? Because that's awesome.To be fair, kizer called a timeout with 2 seconds left in the quarter on his own 1 yard line todayAny video of that? Never heard of that one beforeI'm glad he has a sense of humor about it.The team *did* try hard. They mostly didn't give up this season, or last season, which is why Hue is coming back, much to the disappointment of most of us Browns fans.  One thing I will say about Hue, he makes his guys play hard. He's a horrible horrible OC/HC hybrid, but he *does* get his guys to play hard.Jesus Christ I just realized how close his name was to a new meaning of No - 32.üòéüëçDisney is why the Browns cant winSo 4 Star Wars movies, and in that duration 1 win for Browns.     If the browns win more do we get more Star Wars movies?   Butterfingers^^tm new spokespersonEvery damn time Happy New Year!That "Happy New Year" makes this extra brutal. He know he will never live this downHoly shit that Happy New Year is placed perfectly!That graphic is brutal for that shotExactly. It isn't just one play that makes you that bad.Right? Like even if he catches it, there‚Äôs no guarantee they get the touchdown. And of course the fact that they had 15 other games they could have won. But he‚Äôll be remembered for that.What play is this?Kizer gifted it to him after escaping pressure too, just hammer in the disappointment even more for one of the few times he doesn't fuck up a potential clutch momentKizer is the perfect qb and leader when he doesn't have to play football.  Even of its not with the browns, I'd love to see him be a successful guy in a few years. He shouldn't have played a snap this year, but he's given it everything and keeps doing thw little things like this, even when he is obviously worn down by the loainghttps://www.google.com/amp/amp.si.com/nfl/2017/12/31/steelers-browns-corey-coleman-pass-drop-videoThey have also never lost on their bye week.God damn it, I hate that so much because it's true.. Have an upvote.üéµCome on down to Clevelandtown everyone!üéµ  Get a house for the price of a V-C-Rthere is no bright sideA giant hole could open up underneath the entire city of Cleveland, swallowing all inhabitants, thus putting a decisive end to a winless season and failure of a rebooted franchise. Cause I'm Mr Brightside Drop a preseason game, add a regular season game and slip in another bye week. I think the NFLPA could agree to thatThe Lake will transform him into the Lake Erie Monster, a shittier version of the Loch Ness Monster. He'll also still be the Browns' Head Coach> -1-17  That record is pure brownsGo 0-16 while also having a win from a previous year voided0-0-16  Give us hope every single week, only to have it yanked fram us at the end. Next year, the Browns will have watched Dorsey spend all of their newly acquired assets only to go 0-16 one more time. *In the same year the Cardinals beat the Indians*Also I heard Baltimore could use a new teamThat's exactly what happened to the Lions before their 0-16 regular season[deleted]This is the best one by farBut we would also get to make fun of the Bengals, Steelers, and Ravens for not being able to beat Cleveland that year.If that‚Äôs not dominant I don‚Äôt know what is In 2014 they won 7 games. The pattern is 1/2 of previous wins minus 1/2.   7, 3, 1, 0. I think Baker Mayfield would quitThat‚Äôs a weird way to spell Josh AllenJust 1I really do feel bad our pick is #4 simply from an injury...you guys are a playoff team if Watson stayed healthy. Yeah like thatAnd an old and broken Daunte Culpepper!Pre-Megatron Calvin Johnson, when people weren't sure if he was a good pick or not.I know who Megatron is... but who's Jason Hanson? Was he the kicker?Again??I agree. Hue certainly isn't the end of the problems, but he's a damn good start. 1-31 isn't the record of a coach who needs time to install his system or get new players, it's a *bad coach*. The Browns cannot wait to fire him, even if it's just for financial reasons. I honestly don't think you'll get butts in seats with him in town.You got the "nure" which is good.  An then the "ma" in front of it.  Ma-nure.  we would have been if josh lambo didnt choke last year lmaoI don't know, even without the special flair, the cold embrace of the lake sounds pretty good!Yikes. That definitely defines their season.how in the worldDown 4. We still needed a TD.This is the greatest thing I have ever heard.

They were horrible before he dropped that pass and they were horrible after. No, but it does perfectly encapsulate what made 0-16 a reality: whenever push came to shove, the '17 Browns shit all over themselves.No, they would have won the super bowl if he caught thatOrlovsky scrambled out the back of the endzone for a safety, in one of the few close games the Lions could have actually won that yearThat was a flawless play by Kizer and Coleman fucked it upI'll admit I haven't watched a ton of Browns football but I feel like Kizer isn't even that horrendous of a QB, I just think Hue Jackson is a horrible coach.He looked decent in this game. Admittedly, I only saw the last 5 minutes.Everyone knew he wasn't going to be NFL ready though and would need time to develop. Even Brian Kelly knew that shit and said it. Yet somehow, someway he will get the lions share of the blame.Yikes.....Under construction since 1868! And expand the rosters from 53 to 55/56 players.It would certainly be an even browner mark on an already brown recent history> **-1-17**  > That record is **pure browns**  Shit, did we just choke as the best at being the worst?Cant have win from previous year voided if you didnt win a game the previous year.   *Taps forehead**And the hawks return to StL to eliminate the Cavs in the East finals*I like this outcomeThey'll go to Southern Maryland They can have this one. We'll take the original one back.Haslam family sells the Browns to an ownership group based out of St. Louis. the Browns won all of theirs too. 0 - 18Ahha progress!The Darnold, then.I mean it‚Äôs fine if Watson stays as good as he was. I can‚Äôt remember a season this disappointing. Everyone just got hurt. This last game was just Clowney. It would be sweet if we had top picks to look forward to afterwards but it‚Äôs worth it for Watson I think. You can't forget "Safety" Dan Orlovsky!https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/2008.htm  He had 1,331 yards that year. Next highest guy was 332 yards. He also scored 12 of their 18 receiving touchdowns. Yikes. Yep, and IIRC he holds the record for the longest tenure with a single team (1992‚Äì2012). He played with Barry Sanders *and* Matthew Stafford.He was one of the best kickers in league history.During the cavs finals victory parade, a cavs fan ate some of a police horse's shitDuring the Cleveland Cavaliers finals one of the fans picked a piece of horse turd off the ground, threw it up in the air and caught it in his mouth with exuberance.

"Can you believe it?  Come out of a time out and you can't beat the playclock."  Nantz was the very image of incredulity.BoomIn that case, I vote for the status quo in Cleveland.Tell that to Safety DanThe final score was 12-10.I remember that but I missed the Corey Coleman play thats why he fucked it up. he was expecting a pass 15 feet above his head.That's exactly how I feel. Disclaimer, I'm a big ND fan.  Kizer makes a lot of rookie mistakes that have been compounded by pretty awful coaching and putting him in a really tough position. There's a reason why Cleveland has a history of turning out and ruining pretty much the past 10 QBs they've drafted.   At some point, I don't think it's really because they can't draft talent (although in same cases you kind of wonder what they were thinking), but rather just because they consistently put those QBs in positions where they can only fail and then the team moves on instead of giving those players any opportunity to actually learn and grow.   Kizer makes a lot of boneheaded mistakes. He did at ND on occasion and he does now, but that's a little bit to be expected of the youngest rookie to start QB in the NFL. Cleveland's problems are not because of their drafts (which should be able to have a moderate level of success, at least definitely not 0-16 bad) but rather because their coaching and support staff are atrocious and don't really do anything to help those players get put into a position to win. This was one of his better games. But even that came with a bad int and another that should have been but for a great wr turned db play by HigginsüéµCome see our river that catches of fire!üéµThat should be done regardless Got screwed by the refsBrowns fans are gonna be the meme kings of the offseason now, aren't you? Brandywine Browns We all know in 10 years they'd be sitting at 0-16 as wellFuck it, Haslam will move his team to LA as well So I'm assuming the offensive gameplan was to chuck it up to Johnson and pray for the best.Also one of, if not THE best kicker from 50+ ever.   Also has some pretty hilarious kicker tackle highlightsy thoHoly shit the way he threw it up in the air and caught it in his mouth, I fucking lost it. Thank you for this.You could tell that guy was on a lot of drugs*Holy shit.Kizer scrambled out to his left on 4th and 2, threw a good pass to Coleman down the field and the ball went right through his hands.Definitely read what you said wanting a description of the browns play to follow.

Dan MarinoI‚Äôm guessing Pat Riley if it‚Äôs another sports figure in the area.Jerry probably has the sense to get a high end escort not a shitty rub n tugIt‚Äôs like the grim reaper banging hookers.

That's all I'd be doing Was off the Remy had a papooseI‚Äôm not 100% convinced this isn‚Äôt a conspiracy committed by the Dolphins.one can argue that one of the benefits of consensual regulated prostitution is to put places like this out of business by undermining their client base.I‚Äôve watched a doc on prostitution and I remember seeing these girls basically take home nothing and send it back home and they work nonstop basically. There‚Äôs plenty in the Bay Area too. Full quote from the article:  > ‚ÄúThey were cooking on the back steps of the business. These women were sleeping in massage parlors, on the massage tables and had no access to transportation,‚Äù said Synder, who noted the victims were averaging eight clients a day. ‚ÄúIf you do the math, that is about 1,500 men a year, with no days off.‚Äù  The math... does not check out.Truly a happy endingThe last time a sports person was caught at a happy ending spot, Leicester won the premier league.

Tmz will release it probablyFuck it I do, that shit would be hilarious.I guarantee you somebody outside of law enforcement has that video. When you run an illegal prostitution ring those tapes are insurance, and with the right clientele could be worth more than the business itself.Eh, Pats fans should be accustomed to controversial clandestine videotaping.  Per Hue Jackson: "I'll have to look at the tape."For once, it will not help them. We're re-signing Welker?There's a 0% chance Gronk doesn't say this exact thing at some point during a post-game interview.We couldn't have asked for a happier ending to this seasonTom Brady hasn‚Äôt been suspended yet so no.

The real conspiracies probably get deleted. /r/conspiracyProbably just drinking buddies with a beat cop in jupiterIt truly boggles my mind that any rich dude, much less Robert fucking Kraft, would choose to go the route of "Orchid Day Spa in Jupiter, FL" over a hotter/more willing/legal IG model. Like I just don't get it lol*A DISGUSTING ACT*I knew it. They are real.Yeah, I would love to know the process and mindset for these sorts of things to happen.   Has Kraft never before used a prostitute of any kind, and he thought he'd give it a try and happened to get busted?  I assume he has plenty of liquid cash that he could use higher end prostitutes.  The movies make it seem like these ladies exist, so I assume they actually do.  Though if I was suddenly a billionaire, I'm not sure I would know how to go about finding a high class hooker.Shit dude, can I get a hit? Been having a rough time recently... Yo man, gotta bring your own needles. Strange how sports media just kind of moved on from that one, isn‚Äôt it?[Investigators confirm there is video of each of these listed men engaged in sexual acts inside that spa](https://twitter.com/EricaRakow/status/1098989063066079233)!!!Inside of him? Yikes. He was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution not trafficking. Yeah  https://twitter.com/KatNBCBoston/status/1098987819157073920He's a billionaire, why doesn't he just have real hookers visit him at his compound rather than slumming it at day spas like the rest of us scrubsI've always wondered if these things really existed, I just found out there is one like 5 blocks from me on the same block I do laundry.  It didn't hit me for 10 years why this business was never open, and why there was curtains blocking everything. I't didnt even have a proper name. Its just there.Fuck man all the shady mausesses places I try to score at end up  being drug densThis is a worse look than most other options.   If you're gonna solicit a prostitute your best bet is someone advertising themselves online, or working the street. (or if you're super rich like Kraft just go the Nevada for fucks sake). Otherwise you're going to be getting into a human trafficking situation  Escort services and rub & tug places are going to be full of people who have been forced into it. Feel like it's common sense that the women jerking guys off at spas are there against their willaka deflating the ballsFeels like it's been months.I am shaking my head in disbelief, and also kind of chuckling at the same time.  Of course this happens.He did his job 20 years ago by hiring Belichick, now he has to find something to do with his time.DO YOUR HANDJOBI wonder if that's what he said to the hooker. Shit, that's much better.Tiger woods How is Pat Riley a bigger name than a billionaire NFL owner of multiple superbowls? Tiger may fit that description but it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking so I‚Äôm inclined to believe it‚Äôs not him either. Think about what‚Äôs close to Jupiter, FL...I bet they all sign NDAs too so there‚Äôs no snitching to reporters [deleted]Yeah... this is what blows my mind more. You're a billionaire, I feel like you can do better than mini-mall massage parlors.> Back in 2005 Patriots owner Robert Kraft was in Russia when a funny thing happened: Russian president Vladimir Putin stole his $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring. **Actually for the past eight years, Kraft had let everyone believe he gave the ring to Putin as a gift, but the truth came out this week: Putin stole it** -- or took it without asking if 'stole' is too strong of a word for you.   >  **"I took out the ring and showed it to [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, 'I can kill someone with this ring,'"** Kraft said at an event this week, via the New York Post. "I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out."  >  Kraft might have helped America dodge World War III because instead of going after the ring, **Kraft let Putin keep it -- at the insistence of the White House. Yes, someone at the White House called Kraft and insisted he let Putin keep the ring.**  For the unaware.  Emphasis mine.  https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/patriots-robert-kraft-vladimir-putin-stole-my-super-bowl-ring/Yeah if you're a 77 year old billionaire and can't get jerked off on demand, what was it all for?Credit to Kraft, if I had his money I'd either be in a jail cell or lying in a ditch somewhere in Vegas overdosed on drugs.

The good old days.Patriot's Owner Robert Kraft was asked who's Floridaman: him or Redskin's ILB coach Rex Ryan. Kraft answered "I don't compare myself with anybody", rolled up his sleeve to show a tattoo of the Florida flag with a Chinese character over it and continued "I'll let you interpret that however you want".For real; I like fun, wild conspiracy theories like lizard people and secret moon bases and alien pyramid people.  I don't believe them, but they're fun to read about and you can laugh about them.  But the conspiracy theories in that sub now exist solely to drive political narratives and/or blatant anti-Semitism.  It sucks.So it was just a normal daycare with an ugly building and Reddit decided to harrass the owners? Sounds right I liked when the mods started actively censoring actual conspiracies in favor of partisan garbage. Can't have that, we gotta focus on the pizza place that doesn't have a basement running a child sex ring out of their nonexistent basement because they're tangentially related to Hillary Clinton.I miss Chupacabra, remote viewing, shadow people, etc. conspiracies.  Basically, Art Bell type content.  Welcome to 90% of conspiracy theories generally.Remember r/incels? I remember being blown away at one of their top posts about how they blame the Jews for promoting rap music and turning all girls into sluts, which by default forced them all to be virgins. I'd imagine there's a lot of overlap between r/incels and r/conspiracy. As a Jew, they can fuck off with that shit.Dude could have tipped off the press about this for cash and instead he posted about it on r/conspiracy  So of course Florida.Like you‚Äôve never done anything incredibly stupid and head scratching in the pursuit of busting a nut He‚Äôs old school.

While probably not actually legal, he could easily find hundreds of willing IG models that would very gladly sleep with me for any number of times and keep it much more private.  This man has billions of dollars and would prefer to pay $80 for a handy instead of paying for much more attractive model.Let me take a hit and jump through a burning table.This entire comment tree is gonna get AIDSIt didn‚Äôt have a headline like this. It was also kind of so dark that it wasn‚Äôt fun. There's a dude born in 1934... How the fuck does he even have the sex drive to go to a spa and pay for sex Imagine having to sort through the footage of Florida men getting tugged off.....and *then* seeing Robert Kraft...Oof. Dick Palmer being busted for getting jerked off in a spa. That's as good as it's going to get. That's terrible! Is there any way that it was somehow uploaded online? What website do you think it would be on? So I can avoid it That's some damn fine investigating if I don't say so myself. Talk about going deep undercover.Only Tom Brady could get that in there without Kraft noticing. Phew?That blank asterisk probably said ‚Äòsexual favors in exchange for money‚Äô.

Guess the habit of not splurging on free agents comes from the top.What the hell? This is even crazier than the old man hand job story.I mean, couldn't Kraft just ask the NFL for another one?  Seems like a unique enough circumstance to warrant doing so.> 'I can kill someone with this ring,'  I never knew that was Putin's response.

They got married when she was 25 and he was 63. I think she expected him to die soon but this woman has been sucking on some wrinkly ass balls since her 20's, waiting for this dude to die and it's become apparent that this guy might out live her. I don't think they're marriedYeah, now that the evil rich fuckers can fly to China and get convict organs implanted, gold diggers really have to start rethinking their long-term strategies.Oh, she has.Probably had to clean it up too. she should be happy one of her chores is already done by someone else$$$$$$$$$$$Yeah you need like two or three, at least. Don't you put that evil on my daughter, Ricky Bobby.Seriously, what happened to the days when that crazy guy with frizzy hair on the history channel was as malicious as it got?  Same thing happened with PizzaGate. Just a regular pizza parlor that a lot of DC politics folks happened to go to, so obviously there's a child sex dungeon in the basementIf women are all sluts throwing themselves at guys everywhere then how the hell are these guys virgins?Shit I get it now TruHonestly I would trust the asians at a massage parlor to be more discreet than an IG model. IG models are addicted to money and fame. They‚Äôd have no embarrassment about selling their story for more money and press. Look what happened to the clippers owner. But THIS human trafficking ring sure is a hoot, isn't it?TB12 system!I'd imagine you just lay there and someone takes care of you, right?  He's old, man.

Women would only want to have sex with awful, disrespectful, stupid, Chad bros. They're not interested in the super classy, cheeto-dust-covered members of the male population. It couldn't possibly be that incels are just shitty pieces of human filth that repulse every woman they try to talk to. By slut what they really mean is sexually free enough to want something in a partner instead of settling down and marrying a man simply because he's a man with a job.  The irony is these guys don't even have jobs, so even in the late 40s/early 50s (the period they idolize), they'd still have been losers.I mean it isn‚Äôt. But like the reason all of these comments are jokes is that the Asian people at this parlor are faceless people who we never see as opposed to the cheerleaders who we see every Sunday. It‚Äôs fucked up but the god honest truth is that people don‚Äôt give a shit about faceless foreigners. I guess when you have so many rings on one hand, you gotta get some help...p l i a b i l i t y**THE PATRIOT WAY**Like, that's so sad, though.  I cant imagine doing that.

Despite their coaching, the browns looked like more than semi-cohesive as a team, and that defense is pretty good. Ben played like absolute shit and I hope he gets his shit together, but Conner looks good and JuJu is ballin out.   Browns, I'm excited for the rematch. No tie-ing that one! Welcome to the factory of kissing your sister.Hue contract extension incoming!!Browns are now ranked 15th (tie) in the entire league.Here comes 0-0-16 with the boysI said I wouldn't be surprised if the Steelers lost this game.

Its the most browns things I have ever witnessed Why does everybody assume that Pittsburgh sucks and/or played down to their opponent rather than assuming that the Browns might actually have a squad this year? We would have won if we had a QBEven when they don't lose they can't win.  we going 0-0-16 boys!The *still* undefeated Cleveland Browns!Very browns thing to do to end a losing streak with a tie, but they sure played a hell of a game against a perennial contender.   Taylor looked great, Josh Gordon even saw some action. Myles Garrett looked dominant throughout the game, and he‚Äôs just getting started. Secondary looked very capable, they were still able to make plays in unfavorable weather conditions against one of the more elite receiving units in the NFL.   Browns are gonna be a fun team to watch this yearDoes this means the browns have a better record than the Saints? That Cleveland defense is looking good thoughThis game was both the most exciting game today and the most hilariously sloppy. But in fairness it was pouring like crazy. At the beginning of the 4th, my friend and I was watching and said how it would be funny if this ended in a tie.Good...job Cleveland?A bit surprised the title wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúSteelers turn the ball over 5 times without losing game.‚ÄùThe Browns are 1-31-1 over the last 33 weeks of football.

Hue is always thinking six steps ahead.That losing streak has officially been upgraded to a winless streak, baby!This is the best take on this situation by far.This is the kind of event that builds a lore, the kind of trivia that will be brought up decades later whenever some other team goes on a losing streak.  "So and so are on a near record breaking losing streak. The other only team to have a losing streak this long was the 2016-2018 Cleveland Browns who broke their streak with a TIE of all things."

Perfect Fuck you, I laughed.What happens if they tie every game this season?You're God damn right Just like nobody beats Kentucky 32 times in a rowI was so angry when they went to the post game show "due to contractual obligations"NFL is such a clusterfuck with letting fans (legally) watch games.  They are the most popular sport in America, have by far the fewest games, yet want to force people to buy shitty direct tv, and then get the NFL package on top of that, to watch games. Spending hundreds more than other major league sports charge, despite there being significantly less games to watch.  Roger Goodell sucks so fucking hard.streams my dudeShowed here in Ohio You can't get that same symmetry from a Payton or a Bellecheck. This is the artistry that Hue can do.Tie-rod TaylorI made a comment a few days ago about how the Browns were going to go 0-15-1 this year.  I am a lifelong fan of the Michigan Wolverines and Detroit Lions. My teams have brought me nothing but heartbreak, but I thank God everyday for not being a fan of the Cleveland Browns.2008 Bengals were 1-11-1 at one point. Best record everPerfectly balanced.Itssomething,jpegI mean, 8-8 was supposed to be a huge success this year. I'll take a .500 startIf the Browns go 0-0-16, is that equivalent to 8 wins or is it equivalent to 0 in the standings?  *BLESS EM'*I mean your team went from 1-31 to tying a super bowl contender last year.

Didn't lose but like... +5 TO differential and a tie is the best you can do?Actually not really, mainly because for a second there it looked like we had it pretty much wrapped up prior to that field goalYes. We were down 21-7, pushed to the brink multiple times and held firm. We had one good shot to win the game and the Steelers had multipleI feel a strange combination of disappointment and relief.   I said that I would cry if we won the game or lost the game... I didn‚Äôt cry. We're pissed, so of course they're happy.I'll take average.Yeah this game was a clusterfuck. Cleveland got some good pressure at key moments to make those big plays, we had 5 turnovers and the weather was super shit. Way too many penalties too.  This is the most week 1 Steelers football I‚Äôve ever seen. We effectively gave the game away and barely managed to get a tie out of it.The Steelers could play an FCS team and need a FG in OT to win it.I've decided that Steelers always play down because Ben, AB, and literally none of the defense watch film when they think they can dominate a team.They'll hang 40 on KC next week and then Ben will go 8-22 for 107 yds and 2 picks against Tampa the following week. It's maddening.u ever seen the Mark Richt Georgia Bulldogs?Soft isn't the word I'd use.   Frustrating and stupid luck.   The game would have been a blow out if Ben didn't shit the bed.The streak didn't end, it just changed from a losing streak to a winless streak. Mike Tomlin Steelers just doing our part...That's improvement0-0-16  And then a wildcard game that literally lasts for eternity.Are you sure you're a Jets fan?You're GOD DAMN right. WaitIm fine with the browns going 14-0-2 this year. Thats the best I can offer@Thanos approvesWhy do winning teams love to throw shade down at the rest of us so much? Why can‚Äôt more people just let a team start to change their script somewhere? It was an unlucky blocked FG away from being a legit win - and a under thrown pass from never making it to OT and a W.  Go BrowniesIf we cant win, nobody wins.nobody beats the browns 17 times in a row and gets away with it!Fuck ties> Taylor looked great  I don‚Äôt think you know what the word great means. He was 15/40 for 150 yards after sacks. That‚Äôs not good. At all.    6 timesi‚Äôm really scratching my head trying to remember the last team we beat....It's something ‚ÄúI think bluth could go as high as DON‚ÄôT BUY‚ÄùIt's also a 1-game unbeaten streak!!!It also can mess people up if another team has a longer losing streak but the Browns have the longest break without a win.I mean, it was only the 6th (tied) longest losing streak ever.  Also one of the other 17 game losing streaks ended in a tie, oddly enough.I just can't imagine it again like this though"Of all the Cleveland Browns in the world, you're the Cleveland Browniest"Step 1 to go 0-0-16 this season.I told my friend "even when the browns don't lose, they still don't win."Leveon: ‚Äúy‚Äôall need me‚ÄùDon't be sore, your team is goodHave you tried fielding a defence?Not a browns fan but I am now til the tie streak endsIt sure was in 2014.God I hope soCame back for this comment, it did.Guaranteed. That year the bungles tied the Panthers it fucked up the playoff picture for the entire rest of the season.I would not mind thisThe funny thing is, if the other teams in the division have losing records (which would be quite possible given that each of the other 3 teams will have 2 ties each), 0-0-16 would *win* the division.What if they became the first team to go 0-16, 0-0-16, and 16-0?I got you to 11!> 6 karma  You, like, reverse jinxed it. THE TURKEYS A LITTLE DRY!Puts them between an 8-8 and 9-7 team. I think.Hence illegal streams until NFL allows a legitimate per-game service and not fucking cable additions.Same. I was super pissed because they put it on, I went to go grab a drink and when I came back they had Pats 5th qtr playing. Spent the whole OT flipping between reddit and my fantasy app trying to figure out wth was going on.Yep getting my updates from reddit was not the most pleasant of things.   It played out something like this   --Takes a deep breath and scrolls down-- Comment- ohh shit   Me to myself- but is that a good shit or bad shit???  I thought the Heidi game set the precedent that every game would be shown in its entirety. Not in Cincinnati. They cut it at the end of regulation. Make it 1-313-1 and they'll have a palindromeYou cant even spell the name right Perfectly balanced as all things should be.>Payton or a Bellecheck  those spellings hurt my soul HueuHTide Pod?Tuh-rod TaylorI'm a Michigan and Browns fan. KILL. ME.Here in Toledo I had the choice between the Michigan game yesterday, or a re-run of The Watchmen.  One was a grim view of a dystopian alternative reality, a sad derivative of a an earlier, far more creative and generally greater original.    The other was based on a graphic novel.Each tie counts as half a winIt's a .500 record, so it would be equivalent to 8-8It's equivalent to 8 wins. Team rankings (within divisions and for wildcard) are decided first by "won-lost-tied" percentage, which counts a tie as half a win. So you have 16 half-wins in 16 games, which is the same won-loss-tied percentage as 8-8-0. Where it gets really wacky is if a team goes 0-0-16 and they tie another team that goes 8-8-0 while splitting all their games within the division, against common opponents, and within the conference. The fourth tie-breaker for a head-to-head is "strength of victory", which is the won-loss-tied percentage of teams you beat (double counting if you defeat a team twice). For the 0-0-16 team, this is undefined 0/0 -- 0 wins and 0.5*0 ties over 0 games played by teams you beat.üôèüèªThanksI'm not convinced that is what I just watched.Alcohol free. This isn't Pittsburgh.Gotta be the most Browns thing ever; end a 17 game losing streak....with a tieThat would be amazing.   Although it'd blue ball an entire city for months. tying our way into the playoffsFOOTBALL GODS MAKE THIS HAPPENAnd a wild cardThat‚Äôs equivalent to 8-8 so they‚Äôd have a chance to get in the playoffsSo is 0-0-16 better than say 7-9-0?If this happened, how would they be placed in the standings for playoffs?How can you not be romantic about the Browns? Hey I think the Bills have dethroned you guys as the worstIt‚Äôs weird how /r/cfb can have post game threads posted on time with as many games as they have, but it‚Äôs been an issue on /r/nfl for as long as this sub has been a thingMan, can you imagine a team making the playoffs without winning a game? Only the Browns could pull off an undefeated season in which they miss the playoffs. Pirates won 5 in a row to get back to .500!I hate my lifeIm so upset about MacMac miller‚Äôs death has me depressed...Those poor Steelers fans.PIT fan here, i choose to look at this week as "Steelers commit 7 turnovers against the Browns, almost win the game"  And before you ask yes, i am drunk......> Mac Miller died (RIP)   Jesus Christ UNDEFEATED SEASON STILL IN THE CARDSAnother perfect season, another paradeNa man, after that we gotta spread them even 4-4-4-4Ya this is the epitome of all of our cursed stats rolled up into one.   We recovered the fumble 6.it's just so funny I cackled when we got blocked in OT.  It was fittingHee hee!Baby steps m8lol what are you new to Brown's football or something?End of regulation and end of OT were both chances that need to be converted into winsBrowns had multiple chances too but the offense was not good.Buuuut Connor looked great!6 turnovers!"Gave the game away" is a bad take. The Browns pummeled Ben.Pay attention to this comment folks because it's getting 5x gold when he turns out to be almost exactly correctI approve of this timeline I can tell you‚Äôve been paying attention the last few years.-Hue Jackson, probably He did say "one of""Browns go undefeated despite not defeating divisional opponent Steelers"  That would make for a great headlineYou flair confuses me greatly.  Please die a painless death surrounded by family and friends?Against the Steelers, that's a good team to tie  FTP1 game undefeated streak broDON'T BUY BLUTHThey haven't lost this year!How Shitty can the Browns get?   They could fuck up ANOTHER team‚Äôs losing streak record. The 1-31 over two seasons is what‚Äôs tripping people up. You see that and assume the losing streak must be near that many losses, but the win happened almost exactly in the middle of those 32 games.What are the other streaks? Are any of them in the modern era with the same type of salary cap environment that we have today? Seems like the modern environment would make this sort of thing much harder to pull off.That could make the playoffs in the AFCConnor had a fantastic game outside of the fumble Is he a QB now?RB is the least of our concerns at this point in time...nope.We haven't beaten these motherfuckers in 13 years.We won't if they don't.Tried it a few times during the game, got flagged for it.Never forget that at one point the Browns led the division that year with a 7-4 record while led by Starting QB Brian Hoyer.you could technically say you were undefeated!Just one step closer to 16-0-0.Would you still get the number 1 overall?Damn, I would love to have 39916800 karmaReddit is a weird place, my dude.CURSE YOU MONKEYS HANDHoly fucking shit. You could win 8 games and STILL not be better than the team who hasn‚Äôt won a single game.

Two more losses, and it‚Äôs 1-33-1, and that works just the same.Bellecheck sounds like an an online bank or somethingWith all six stones I could simply snap my fingers and the Browns would cease to exist  I call that mercy/r/insidethefactoryofsadness/r/HuedidnothingwrongTuh-rod Tie-lorIowa State and Browns checking in. Football season usually means death Oh please there are a hundred college football teams that are worse.  The only problem with Michigan is unrealistic expectations.My god, your poor liver. I‚Äôm a Michigan fan as well but the Pats more than make up for it. But is 8-8 actually functionally the same as 0-0-16 or is the tiebreaker given to actual wins?  My other thought was that maybe ties just act like a tiebreaker, putting a team ahead of others with the same number of real wins (7-6-3 finishes ahead of a 7-9 team but behind an 8-8 team) [TFW you discover a new way to go 8-8.](https://giphy.com/gifs/nfl-football-dallas-cowboys-l0Exu6nEmNsSDri5G)An 8-8 team and a 0-0-16 team couldn't be in the same division. You could have a 7-7-2 team and a 0-0-16 team, though, which is an entirely believable outcome for the Browns and Steelers this year.So, in *theory*, you could have a team with 0 wins  represent the division in the playoffs.  My godYou must have missed the Bills...thing. OofSo no different than a full bud light.Those mountain people my dude lolroll yinzers? Wild card sneak in If that happens I will 100% kill myself First true unbeaten 16-game season, 4-0-16I've watched this shit my whole life.Shut up. Please. I can't take any more.Having the Browns score more than 9 teams is shocking lmaoAlmost like /r/soccer where they didn't even sticky the world cup final.Seems to me it could be automated pretty easily.... cough mods cough It's because r/cfb let's users post the post game thread. Can you imagine a team missing the playoffs without losing a game?Would be amazing, but a .500 record seldom gets you into the playoffsToo little too lateGreat, both teams are .500 now.That just hurts their draft pick and draft bonus pool. Fr I almost ODed to one of his albums one time. That one hits deepWhen you're 3 years old it's time to go beyond baby stepsWell I jumped onto the Browns train during their 10-6 season in 2007. So I guess you can call me a bandwagon browns fan?Agreed. We had an easy opportunity at the very end of the 4th quarter to throw a quick 10 yard pass down the middle and kick the GW FG with ~25 seconds left. Instead, we attempt a deep ball down the sideline that gets picked off. To be fair OT is when the weather went from pretty shitty to outrageously shitty.  It's really not that weird that this game ended in a tieIt‚Äôs not like he was getting it out quick. He was holding on to the ball too long a lot(credit to Clevelands DB‚Äôs) or throwing shit quick reads. "No one else could've done this"You mean the big B doesn't stand for browns??? What have I done!?The pain ;(I didn't watch the game, but this seems like a great point. If the Browns held the Steelers to a tie, they've got to be way better than last year.Could end up really screwing them come playoff seed time.[deleted]Top is Cardinals back in the 1940's.  The 2007-2009 Lions are longer, and the 2015-2016 Browns and 2008-2009 Rams tie it.  Rest are 1960's to 1980's mainlyHow many INTs has Bell thrown? remember when our punter ran like 60 yards lolThat was the year I became a Browns supporter.‚ÄúBrowns go undefeated and winless in 2018.‚Äù  Dude I would love life.Could you theoretically make the playoffs like this?[deleted]I'd love to have a unicorn that shits gold, and yet here we are. Ah, yet another /r/unexpectedfactorialHasn't lost a single game eitherBut not in your own marketexcept for those horrible Facebook gamesBut with rediculous black out restrictionsIn Europe we have GamePass which has all games legally, all NFL Network content, condensed games, historical games... it's great.   Sadly you'll just have to tough it out until the next big TV renegotiation. But you can't watch certain teams if you live in their blackout area.  Can't watch your own team because you live in the wrong place. MLB.tv has blackouts which renders it useless For the first few years of youtube, MLB took down baseball videos, so you had to go elsewhere to see baseball highlights.As long as you aren't in their blackout areas for each team, which are huge and often overlapYea but what do they consider a good or a bad thingOh yeah...well I mean they can both happen1-33-7Something something 3-1 lead? There's the mathematical possibility that Hue's end of season record is a palindrome, but I wouldn't expect it to happen: it requires that the Browns win a game.  But for the record, if they finish this season 1-13-2, Hue Jackson's three seasons with the Browns will have a combined record of 2-44-2I think most people would call it mercy, tbhSeriously though, has anyone figured out what is correct? I had red zone on during the browns game, and Hanson was saying Tuh-rod, he even referenced that we found out that's the correct way to say it this off-season, but I thought it was figured out Tuh-rod was wrong and we have been correct saying Tie-rod. Someone pointed out in a commercial or something where Tyrod referrs to himself as Tie-rod. I don't really care which it is, but not knowing is driving me nuts now. It's the cycle of hope and despair from those unrealistic expectations that hurts, especially when Michigan hasn't been relevant most of my life but they're expected to given their history. And even worse teams like Toledo can still be more fun to root for since they'll do more damage in their smaller conferences.No it would just go normally down the tiebreakers (head to head, division, etc.)Tie breakers follow the [written tie breaker procedures](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-tiebreaking-procedures/)Too soon.Fuck, you caught me off guard.  You posted a gif that wasn't him clapping. I was expecting Jeff Fisher.You're right. I was putting them in the same division because an 0.500 team winning the wildcard isn't realistic, but bad divisions have had 8-8 and even 7-9 teams as winners. The overall point is that the NFL tie-breaker rules aren't well-defined for all possible scenarios.[deleted]TaggedRemindMe! 12/30/2018I have a piece of the bleachers from the last game in the old brown's stadium before we became fake cleveland in baltimore.   I watched fake cleveland win two superbowls. I watched the new browns go 0-16.   I love the browns. I love the game bc we were competitive. [deleted]Worst sports sub and it isn't even close.In the other threads they said it is a bot but it had a lot of confusion with the tie. It doesn't even need a bot. Just let any user make the PGT. Pretty much all other subs without bots do. It's so silly. I hate mod hate, but the mods here make it hard to appreciate their moderation.woahAt this point I don't give 2 flying fucks about the playoffs I just want a winning seasonIt's the first time the Browns have been .500 since [September 20, 2015](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201509200cle.htm).You wanna know how many times I had to watch us lose 90+?  And it doesn't even matter, there are so many teams that are worse than us (especially in *your* division).Hope you‚Äôre doing better nowThat's my new favorite oxymoronWelcome to the Tyrod Taylor experience+1. By OT both sides were soaked and sloppy.   I had a feeling that the ball wouldn‚Äôt move much, and with the new reduced OT length a few possessions is all you get. Seemed locked in when the Steelers punted it with 6 minutes left. **RAVENS intensifies**It was benefited by the awful weather, but our defense looked legit. Our secondary looks actually competent now and Garrett was a freak of nature with 2 two strip sacks to go along with 2 regular sacks. Our offense, specifically Tyrod, was seriously struggling though. It also means the Steelers are hot garbage.Or the steelers are worse than beforeAt least you still have the best looking QB in the league aka TB2.0Damn.. checkmate atheists..Yeah, I do. And you just gave me a stomach ulcer making me recall that.At their peak. Bandwagoners these days smhI never minded the browns... but when that bad call that led to a volley of glass hitting the field and refs during that pittsburgh game years ago is what made me a fan.... It'd be the most browns thing ever we could technically win the division like that too. if our divisionmates split their games with eachother and lose the majority of their games outside the division, a .500 record puts us in the lead.  cleveland browns: the first team to make the playoffs without winning a game.God damnit if they did that and didn't make the playoffs everybody could actually say that have an undefeated season and rehash the same old meme for years and I would probably just kill myselfI think so, but I think it's basically like an 8-8 team making the playoffs since ties count as half a winSeriously though, what pick do you get? Is this the same as going 8-8, could a team win their division by tying all 16 games? [deleted]vpn my dude.Being in Iowa and being a baseball fan is just about the worst thing everYea wtf is thatKnowing the Browns, they can do 1-313-1 **in a single season**.Browns elite confirmed. someone took them from us once, its not mercyIn an interview on Hard Knocks he said that Tuh-ROD is how his family pronounces it, but that people have always called him TIE-rod through his whole career, and he just didn't bother correcting them.It would go to the team that actually went 0-0-16 because any other choice would be fucking with some higher power Well, head-to-head would be a wash, since they would tie with all division rivals twice, effectively being a split for head-to-head.  So the first tiebreaker between a 0-0-16 team and a 7-7-2 team would be win percentage in games played within the conference.You can't see his hands‚Ä¶The Rams and Vikings both went to the playoffs as wild cards with 8-8 records in 2004, but that was a weird year and it hasn't happened any other time.Joke's on you, the Patriots are the other team.  Bill is so flummoxed by the situation that he can't work his dark magic and win.>lasts a full week   So they'll be playing in Miami?  You're checking a lot of my boxes.At that point enough guys would go down from injury or exhaustion that they could just combined the two teams and have them play the PatriotsHow that game didn't end up in a full-scale riot with Art Modell's house going up in flames is astounding to me.> I love the browns. I love the game bc we were competitive.   Yes, couldn't agree more. The defense looks MEAN, bottled up some of the best offensive players in the NFL and kept us competitive throughout.   Is it a shame we didn't win? Sure... but this year really does feel different. We have a new team, it's gonna have teething problems... but finally we have a real team with some genuine stars.r/nba -> r/baseball - r/nfl -> r/soccerFairOr since a few hours ago when they were 0-0I‚Äôm a Cubs fan. Do you know how many hundreds and hundreds of times I heard about 1908 or Bartman?  In baseball, tanking makes sense. Look at how the Cubs and Astros rebuilt. Thanks I amIf we got into our games against you guys with the assumption that you‚Äôre actually a good team we might have a shot tho.I mean, that's not the end of the world though, right? Tyrod is on the roster to give Mayfield time to adjust to the NFL. If the Browns keep it up, you win maybe a couple of games, and call it an improvement. Draft some weapons for Baker, or whatever else you need on offense, cut him loose next year, and actually make some noise. I was watching the score closely as I live in the middle of Steeler country apparently (west coast of Florida)  gotta love having a Bills bar, Steelers bar, Jests shit hole, and a Pats male only bath house, all a quarter the distance of the nearest Dolphins bar.    But I didn't pay attention too much.  How did Landry play?  Gonna go check stats now. I support this narrative.Works for me. one of my few pleasant football memories The direct reason why we arnt allowed nice things at NFL games. We really are the best :)Would be full circle browns something something 30 for 30Are you kidding me? That would be hilarious. Everyone would know that the undefeated season would have an asterisk. And they‚Äôd still go 0-0-16 which is incredible >NFL Tiebreaking Procedures  >The six postseason participants from each conference are seeded as follows:  >The division champion with the best record.  >The division champion with the second-best record.  >The division champion with the third-best record.  >The division champion with the fourth-best record.  >The Wild Card club with the best record.  >The Wild Card club with the second-best record.  >The following procedures will be used to break standings ties for postseason playoffs and to determine regular-season schedules.  >**NOTE: Tie games count as one-half win and one-half loss for both clubs.**  https://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures  So yes, they could win their division if an 8-8 record was enough to do so.zuck moneyIf you miss every shot you don't take, then by the transitive property, you lose every game you don't play.  That gives them 240 losses for the season, not counting the playoffs.Yeah people forget that if you put any team in over a 0-0-16 team a meteor will instantly obliterate the earthIts obviously thwarted by Hue's beige magic.There are games in the wildcard round?it was pretty rioty. I was real young though. /r/nba is a little to unserious for me these days.  But I'd go   /r/cfb -> /r/baseball -> /r/nba -> /r/nfl -------------------------> /r/soccerI'd put hockey between basketball and baseball. That sub is pretty funAt least you have the penguins...That doesn't actually give them a w/l %. Oh I thought you were a Indians fan  Yeah tanking works but it's just too late to tank at this point, plus, a LOT of times it just doesn't work, I mean just look at the White SoxI wouldn't want to put Mayfield behind that paper thin o-line. Lol im pretty sure its also why all stadiums have plastic bottles and cups now I don‚Äôt know enough about math to dispute this so I‚Äôm gonna treat this as gospel and fight anyone who dares prove me otherwiseWhat's a wild card?Oh, yeah - I've seen film of the game. Fans setting off cherry bombs, dismantling the old, wooden bleachers at Municipal Stadium (accidentally helping the demolition crew), confrontations with the Cleveland Police Department.   I love the way the [Browns players jogged right over to the Dawg Pound and embraced the fans after it was over](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TO7LlFuPa3D4fHDvpZqb9g--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTk1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4eccf141cf0c9127ccc7d96bc3e9da4c).

r/nfl, Imagine telling Gronk when he was drafted that he would retire before the then-33-year-old Brady.Crazy to think he's not even 30 yet. I mean, he will be soon, but damn.**Regular Season:**  7,861 Yards   79 Touchdowns   5 X Pro-Bowl   4 X All-Pro   **Post Season:**  1,163 Yards   12 Touchdowns   3X Super Bowl ChampPoor Jeremy Maclin has his announcement totally overshadowedShaq Mason about to give up his jersey number to pay respectsPress 69 to pay respectsOH FUCK. Helluva career.Yo soy fiestaAnd his career defining moment... Wrestlemania!Legend. He will be missed Damn this is absolutely insane.   Glad he can go on his terms in a way, and glad he went out a champion, the dude was broken down yet gave it his absolute all on the field this year, we‚Äôre gonna miss his blocking, receiving, and attitude for sure.   See you in canton Gronk, definitely the most dominant TE of all time when healthy His last catch of his career won them a title. God damnit Gronk I‚Äôm gonna miss your ridiculous assHall of famerI am legitimately sad. I‚Äôm gonna miss that massive human barreling down the field. My reaction is the same as Joey when he found out about Monica and ChandlerThis is the worst birthday present I have ever gotten  EDIT: FUCKING UCF ARE YOU SERIOUS? GODDAMN IT, JUST DO A BOUNCE PASS NOT A LOB. COULD'VE BEEN A 6 POINT GAME. OR RUN OUT THE CLOCK, THAT WOULD BE EVEN SMARTER. FUCKIN DUKE SURVIVES AGAIN. FUCK THIS.HOF and the most dominant TE off all time. Man injuries are such a bitch. So glad I got to watch him tear shit up over his careerEnjoy crushing poon in retirementLegitimately sad, I love GronkMaclin: I am going to retire today.  Gronk: Hold my 69 beers.Sad, but necessary. Big guy just took too many hits in the wrong places. We'll miss you, Fiesta. No more Gronk spikes on Sunday... games won't be the same for a while. :(happy he went out on top, on his terms, with a ring. thank you for everything gronk, we love you! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôGood thing we have Edelman and uh.....Edelman!Gronk is my favorite player on my least favorite team. He's a clown, he's unstoppable, he's a legend, he's getting into the hall on the first ballot he can. I think that at his peak he's the best TE to ever play the game, 9 years may be relatively short when you look at the career of other guys like Gates or Gonzalez, but Gronk had more success then both of those guys and it took him nearly 10 years less.   One moment I'll always remember is in 2011 his sophomore season when he had a real breakout year his statline against the Jets was something like 10+ catches, 100+ yds and at least 2TDs, I could tell the dude wasn't going anywhere and would be both a force to be reckoned with and a headache for the Jets for years to come.   There is also a play I'll always remember from the Patriots second Super Bowl against the Giants(2012). On a last play hail mary the ball got batted around and Gronk who was playing on a bum ankle came up about a foot short of catching it. I think if Gronk is healthy there, and has an extra step off a good ankle he makes that catch 8 times out of 10 the Patriots win another Super Bowl on the back of their second year freak of a tight end and with the rest of his career in perspective Gronk goes down as the best tight end of all time. Looks like I‚Äôll be spending the night in the fetal position crying Gronk finally makes me happyNo matter how much I hate the Pats, I still loved watching him play. He was an absolute machine before all the injuries caught up to himWow.Give the man a TV show I want Gronk takes on lifeLet's see how that bum Brady does without his top weapon.  /sGood for him. I didn't like watching him hobbling around out there. He looked like a shell of his former self - a little bit like Peyton's last season.  Better to leave it when the time comes, and he's doing it as the greatest of all time. No one dominated like he did.THE PATS DYNASTY IS OFFICIALLY OVER!!!     *sighs, who am I kidding? they still have Brady and Bill...* Today, todos somos fiesta.   Miss you my dude. I will never for get the time you took off your shirt and stole champagne from my buddy‚Äôs table at Royale in Boston.   National goddamn treasure.Yo soy Retirement One horcrux down for Tom Brady So he‚Äôll daybut at mania right??69It‚Äôs absolutely incredible that the Pats won: 3 Super Bowls.  Drafted Gronk. Had the entire Gronk era, 9 year career Won 3 more super bowls in that time Gronk retires.   ...and Tom Brady is still going, through all of that.Worst. Safety. Ever.Got the 69th Upvote ü§ô  https://imgur.com/srw2lXs‚Ä™Actually little upset Gronk‚Äôs retiring but it was definitely time with all those injuries piling up‚Ä¨This jelloshot is for you my sweet prince!  Yo soy fiesta on the giant jetski in the sky~The last catch of his career basically won a Superbowl. Got to go out on topAhh the old Jason Witten move. As a 9ers fan, it was fun watching Gronk dad dick the Seattle defense in 2014 when it mattered.Espn should hire him for the mnf booth.    It would be fuckin perfect As a diehard Pats fan, I had a feeling before the Super Bowl that if we won, Gronk would finish up. I was hoping he‚Äôd have a big moment in the game that we would all remember, and he did. Won‚Äôt be the same without him, but so thankful he played for us. best TE football has ever seenWent in, became the GOAT, got some rings, retired by 30.  Thanks GronkI wrote a poem if you don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs called: 87 on the field; 1 in my heart.  When you first came in  I knew it was love  You caught everything  From the ground above  You were so goofy  And such a gem  You hate opponents  You demolished them  But like every beautiful day  The sun must set  A talent like you  I‚Äôll never forget  So goodbye 87  Goodbye the boi who stronk  Goodbye 69 joke cracker...  Goodbye... Gronk üòî  [Thank you All üòî](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458143107826057228/559499913415884804/image0.jpg) I have the Patriots projecting to draft Noah Fant at #32. They value TEs a lot in New England.  But other than that, Gronk is the most dominant TE of all-time. Gronk's impact on the game was beyond all and the Pats will miss him. Thanks for everything big guy <3This is the second happiest day of my lifeI wanna dieeeeeeeeeeIs this the thread that stays?  Anyway:  ONE DOWN ONE MORE TO GOThe bad man can‚Äôt hurt us anymore. *sad Gronk noises*   Tide pods...Top 6.9 most bittersweet anime momentsVery, very smart move.   He's made millions. He's an easy transition to a million other entertainment venues. He's already been injured far too much. He's accomplished all there is to accomplish.GRONK VS UNDERTAKER CONFIRMED FOR WRESTLEMANIAThread moving so fast no one will notice I love me mumSucks injuries and murders ruined Gronk & Hernandez tandem Next stop, hall of fame.  You‚Äôre an absolute fuckin‚Äô legend Gronk.   PatsNation gonna miss you If I‚Äôm a club within 100 miles of his house, I‚Äôm stocking up everything I have. Before Brady... didn‚Äôt think that would happen We all witnessed something special. That gold jacket will look great in him.Worst free saftey of all time. Thank Christ.  Go you magnificent golden retriever in human giant form. Be free. We will always remember you.A bit of a shorter career but I‚Äôd probably put him as the greatest TE of all time. He could do it all really well, and is always a matchup nightmare. Most dominant TE no question  Now he can do commentary for WWE on Fox with McAfee and Daniel CormierYo Brady. See what Gronk's doing? DO THAT.  I didn't think I'd see Gronk retiring before Brady. The best TE I've ever seen play.I‚Äôm flipping out and my D&D group is like, ‚Äúwtfff‚ÄùEveryone remember mafukin steve harvey broke this news Coaches & kickers. They're the only ones who outlast Brady.... Unless Brady gets the opposing coaches fired. How awesome would it be to retire by 30? You have 40+ years to enjoy life. Good for him.Yeah he was drafted at 20. Sadly he has the durability of a 69 year oldAs a 28 almost 29 year old. Fuck me I am old. Gronk is 3rd all time for receiving TDs before 30 (including playoffs - unfair, I know...). Not for TEs. For Receivers. 1st and 2nd is Rice and Moss. Gronk has missed nearly 2 seasons of games due to injuries.   Oh... and the next TE is Vernon Davis... at 27th.   http://pfref.com/tiny/nqQtF  That's just insane.   edit: he's also 3rd without playoffs, but the next closest TE rockets up to 22nd (Antonio Gates). Injuries have just stole a legend from the NFL. :/Post Career:  Hall of FameThe definition of short but sweet.   It‚Äôs not humanly possible to put up a better career than that in his limited time.  The stats don‚Äôt tell the whole story to be honest. There's not a single 69 in there. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruinedMaclin was an absolute dog on those eagles teamsHoly shit, had no idea he retired. He was our #1 for a few years. Good player and an even better man.good for Gronk, keeping his retirement low key by hiding it behind Maclin‚ÄôsReminds me when Farrah Fawcett died only to be overshadowed by MJ dying soon after Damn. I wish his career wouldn't have gone south so quickly after he was injured in KC. Retirement or not, he wasn't getting another chance on a team. It's crazy how quickly that can happen and he's only 30 years old too!!!"Gronk is the first player to have a number he never wore retired." I‚Äôm really disappointed he didn‚Äôt wait until June 9th to make this announcement.696969696969696969696969696969696969696969696969 ‚ù§Ô∏è696969696969Top 3 TE of all time and only played half of the time.

He‚Äôs gonna run out and attack Brock with a steel chair. That female security guard was able to slow down Gronk better than most NFL defenders.Runner up is his Family Guy episode Raws in Boston tomorrow. I'd be surprised if he didn't make an appearance.Absolute legend. Dude did shit that a man of his size should not be able to do. Defied all odds of what a TE should do. As Dan Le Batard put it (and I paraphrase): "he's like a polar bear with good hands." It was such a pleasure getting to watch him play. And amazing to see his abilities off the field as well.Football will feel different without him. Genuinely an amazing player to watch, and someone who re-defined the position.  I look forward to his HoF induction and the corresponding party.Gronk to WWE confirmedAs a fan of another AFC East team, I respectfully disagree with the second part of your statement.>Legend. He will be missed by the Patriots and nobody else Dude is gonna bring a parade of 20 y.o. girls to Canton with him in 5 years.I've loved watching him play and entertain us off the field. The fact he is so widely liked in an age when most Pats are hated shows how great he is and how likable he was. I'll miss, this sucks. Just an all-time entertainer (and combine that with his GOAT level of play). Had one of the biggest plays of the entire Super Bowl to set them up to get the winning score. Insane. Good to see him go out with that as his last game. Not only did he win, but he performed[the catch in question](https://youtu.be/e1GKMVGhg4k)In his last game, he finished with the same number of receiving yards as his jersey # (87)Can't wait to see his speechFirst ballot[Oh.

Complaining about his birthday when there are millions of us out here without a birthday today.We can make it worse and have Brady retire too.   Please. Might have been a relatively short career BUT he was way above anyone at his peakThe Calvin Johnson Hall of Fame arc. A short career, but outrageously dominant while he had it. I don't know about all time but he reminds me of Calvin Johnson. Have to wonder how good he'd be in the all time ranks if injuries didn't plague him.Felt like he was around 50/50 either rehabbing or dominating the shit out of everyone else. He's gonna have such an incredible legacy that people in 20 or so years are gonna be shocked to learn he only played 9 seasons. And it wasn't even 9 full seasons. His GF is HOT AF. We still got jules. His first TD is gonna be a gronk spike, point into the camera and you see a tear in his eye as he says "Thats for you bro"Jules, James, and Sony going to have to step up their spike game.How dare you soil the good name of Penn State lacrosse player Chris Hogan!If Gronk was healthy, we win that game easily.  Rob was nothing more than a decoy at that point.Steelers defense to avoid covering tight ends all next season in respecthe can't hurt us anymore.Thanks IanNew England loses their guy.They lost their guyJulian Edelman hasn‚Äôt retired (yet)And EdelmanUntil Bill is gone I trust nothing.

Glad to hear itThe bad man can‚Äôt hurt you anymoreWhat was the firstWhat you fail to understand is that by Gronk retiring the Patriots will absorb his youthfulness, granting the league another 10 years of Brady and Belichick Brady or BB?I love your mom too. She's a nice lady. Yeah Hernandez was really good. It‚Äôs a shame his career was plagued with murders. Jesus I just realized Brady outlasted Marvin Lewis coaching the Bengals. Vinatieri is still somehow going.  This will be twenty four for him. *Looks at AFC East* Yup, Brady does get coaches fired. And, he's saved all of his nfl income. The guy was smart about his money.[deleted]He's retired from football, but that doesn't mean that he's done working. He's certainly done being a salaryman, but he'll almost certainly be working in some capacity. They usually don't retire voluntarily.  They are likely persuaded by a team of Doctors who will tell him all the terrible things that could happen to him if he continues NiceI wouldn‚Äôt call it sad. The guy saved his money and gets to really enjoy life now. As a forty year old... just wait.As a 29 year old watching another 29 year old retire for the rest of his life, fuck me I‚Äôm broke. Yeah I know how you feel, I went to college with him and to see someone I went to school with retire with a hall of fame career feels strange.First Ballot HOF‚Äôer.   Nothing against the likes of Gonzalez, Witten & Gates who have had long, very successful careers - but Gronk in his prime was *dominant* to the point of game-wrecking. Hell even when he was injured the past few seasons he was still a force to be reckoned with Can‚Äôt see him waiting too long after eligibility, if he has to wait at all.  Thanks for everything, big guy.Post Career:  Knee deep in titsImagine if he was healthy throughoutEspecially considering all his injuries. Not many tight ends with that many super bowl rings And he was injured for long stretches within that limited timeDude has top end WR numbers as a TE.  And it's not like he was some 'tall WR' type TE, he was a legitimate TE.  He was as elite as a catcher as he was a blocker.  They really don‚Äôt. All-Pro blocker on top of that and just a matchup nightmare. Nothing defenses can do but overcommit which opened up the whole field.  Only stat listed that tells the story is 3 rings and 5 SB appearances in 9 years. That‚Äôs absolutely fucking legendary for a TE.He's probably the best blocking TE in the game. Well was plus the attention he took from. The defense has really helped Edelman and before Welker shine. Like that he was basically your best or second best offensive lineman at the same time lmao. What a fucking monster.The real tragedy is Aaron Hernandez. Those guys together were unstoppable had he made better life choices it would have been really interesting to see how their careers panned out. He averaged .69 touchdowns a game. You're welcome. NBC used to call him, D Jax, and McCoy the ‚Äúbaby birds‚Äù Was he the #1 the year you guys had 0 WR TDs?Yeah when I got home from work that day I heard about MJ and that's it. Fast forward like as week later and I found out about Farrah Fawcett69"69 Reasons Why Gronk Retired Now, Number 69 Will Shocker You!"

I‚Äôm gonna miss the dude. I will not miss however him being open every fucking play!Happy for Gronk to know when it‚Äôs time to step away. Sad that we won‚Äôt get to see him play any more.Gronk is what I imagine Cam would be like if he decided to say fuck being a QB I wanna be a TE   Except Gronk also has phenomenal hands and is a better blocker than like half the league's LTs. Dude is a total freak of nature$2Not with those kneesBAH GAWD! THAT'S GRONK'S MUSIC!Same. I won‚Äôt miss him, but he‚Äôs the greatest TE I‚Äôve seenDolphin fans will commemorate his memory with Miami Miracle replays Bruh have you seeeeeen his girlfriend? He wouldn‚Äôt dare. As a straight man who will be 27 then, I volunteer as tribute. The DiCaprio School of Getting LaidIf only it was two yards further downfield.I rewatched the video a few times and finally remembered where I had seen that before. [This catch](https://youtu.be/DwvG_gV7hgk?t=89) that made a 4 state Broncos fans region collectively shit pants. And you'll notice that the defender tried very hard to swipe that ball away and Gronk kept control of it. I thought the dream was all but about dead when he caught the next pass for a touchdown.Who‚Äôs cutting onionsAnd his final catch set up the game winning TD...on a 69 yard driveI can't wait to hear itIt will be 1 hour and 9 minutes long. Yo soy fiesta$10 says he shows up drunkWho would have thought he'd get there before BradyAnd I'm sure just like Ross plenty of people will be yelling, "Get off my sister!" at Gronk over the coming years.Hmm I don't remember that line in the episodeHappy birthday. At least you still have the GOATr/suspiciouslyspecificOr you could have walked in on Gronk in bed with your wife.truecmon manHe‚Äôs Sanders, Moss, levels of game changer, no doubt. injuries are a bitch too.. would love to have seen Gronk‚Äôs career stats had he not been so hampered by injuries cause the numbers are already insane in the first place The Terrell Davis of tight ends.

Gronk is, without question, the best tight-end ever when he was healthy. Like it isn't even remotely close.Is anyone surprised? He is a legendary famous athlete millionaire with a perfect body and is incredibly attractive.  If a guy like that can't get a hot girlfriend nobody can.[decided to google it, and I‚Äôm just confused](https://images-tmz-com.cdn.ampproject.org/ii/w820/s/images.tmz.com/2019/03/01/0229-camillekostek-instagram-1.jpg)  Bikini by the way in case anyone is at work or something Yes, he‚Äôs loyally taken at the moment with a hot model GF.   Which is far better than sleeping around with gold diggersGronk will smile down at him from the heavens like Mufasa. I now need this to happen, followed by a Brady sneak TD and subsequent spike.We don‚Äôt even have him either, free agentSo business as usual thenThere it is. They lost their guyLets be honest, Jules is good and all.  But Gronk was damn near unstoppable at his peak.   CHAMPION OF THE SUNActually a guy in NXT who is perpetually stoned pronounces it like ‚Äòday butt‚Äô and so I was referencing that, cause the guy would be the perfect partner for Gronk IMO. Still hoping he squashes Corbin and Cena comes outLol fuck it why not. It‚Äôd be so funny if he was super uptight and all about business in the booth. I can just picture him making a ton of sex jokes in the booth.  Joe T:  "Trubisky snaps it, AND HE GETS SACKED!  TREY FLOWERS WITH THE PLAY!"  Gronk:  "That's why you gotta have a good O-Line, Joe.  If your O-Line ain't good, that leads to a high chance of *penetration*, and that just opens the door to a lot of *sacks*."  Joe T:  "Heh-heh-heh-heh, Gronkowski with the, *ahem*, analysis that makes this channel stand out from the others."  Booger:  "That reminds me of this one time where I met the head coach at a gay bar and‚Ä¶"Yeah, Alge Crumpler will have to take a step back.But Brady's still playing...>What ~~was~~  will be the firstWhen Tom Brady retires tomorrowHe's saving the #1 spot for when Brady retiresWhenever Brady retires*Vince McMahon gulp*  ahh fuckAnd his retiring means the Pats now have a nice chunk of cash freed up. You know how many little scrappy gymrat white guys Belichick can buy for $9mil? Like 30 or 40 at least. That's a good benchmark right there.That's freaking crazy. BRADY won more Superbowl's than Marvin Lewis.His parents are pretty well off and "wealthy" in Buffalo. They own the G&G Fitness train here. Even though Bills fans hate on Gronkowski since he played on the Patriots, him becoming such a huge NFL superstar really raised the profile of his parents business. I imagine Gronk is now far wealthier than they are though.If you look at the list of all the injuries and surgeries, it will probably make you hurt all over.  I love Gronk but I'm glad to see him give it up.  And yes, by the time he's 40, he will probably be in constant pain, to say nothing of 50+.  But luckily for him, there are new techniques available today and in the future that will be able to help with that, given that he has plenty of money.  Also weed. I'd trade in a heartbeat over 30 years of construction. If I were Gronk I wouldn't wrestle or do movies. Just endorse products, spike them and cash in. Sit back and laugh.NiceI'm fiddy.  It gets worse.As a 50 year old...just wait. Yeah I thought my knees were wrecked at 30...lolHe always had to be game planned for. So dominant that I as a fan would look and go, is anyone covering himGonzalez was dominant tooI forget which AFC East team Rex Ryan was coaching at the time, but he said if a DB was man to man with Gronk you pretty much had to give the DB a 2x4 to make it an even fight.I 100% agree a HOFer needs to have been dominant several years gronk was the definition of dominance even when he came off of injuryYou forgot SharpeYep. He's the most dominant ever and I think there's a strong case to be made to say he is the greatest ever.Tears man just tears Or if he didn't go to the KHLThe only other one I can think of is Shannon Sharpe. Two of the greatest to ever do it. Gronk is the rare player who can claim to have revolutionized their position in the NFL. He redefined what we think of as the ideal TE, and now people are always looking for the next Gronk.I'm gonna miss seeing this beast run post catch.*also the best WR at the same time.  He was just that dominant The Eagles were so good in Madden NFL Arcade (X360/PS3) with those 3 and Michael VickJust got a dopamine rush from those memories.He wasn't, Dwayne Bowe was, with donnie avery being our number 2. The dark days.HushNah, I think that was Dwayne BoweNice. 696969I need the explosion version. [Not to mention the time he bashed Joe Haden's skull in while celebrating a touchdown](https://youtu.be/vCnAKfCpVhw)LOL, how did I not know about this?  The look on his face . . .wth did I just watch? context?Oh man his games against the Steelers were my favorite. This breaks my heart.He was somehow covered and still wide open on so many plays.The blocking part I feel doesn‚Äôt get enough coverage because of how stellar he is at receiving and how powerful his personality is. The man is an absolute bulldozer out on the edge and in the flats. So many premier receiving tight ends just halfass the blocking, but it‚Äôs like he enjoyed the opportunity.Few months of DDP Yoga and he will be just like newThere‚Äôs no reason for him to be full time at all. He has huge mainstream appeal. ‚ô´ *Summer of '69* ‚ô´As a HUGE fan of Tony G, I completely agree. There are consistent hard workers and then there are freaks that actually reach their potential. Gronk was both. Enjoy your 30s you big dumb Shrek I hate loving but cant avoid.Tony G might have had a better career, but there is no TE I would rather have for a game than Gronk if I could have any in their prime.Grokowski! Doesnt have the angle!Bruh have you seen his trip to Aruba my ex was sorority sisters with Gronk's gf AMAI‚Äôm a grown ass man and I screamed at that play. Thought some real Brady magic was gonna happen that game.  That Denver D was too good. Who‚Äôs just crying human emotion tears For the Pats to win their 6th title out of Brady‚Äôs 9 appearances...  6/9...I can‚Äôt wait to taste itCan't wait to receive it"I'd like to thank Samantha, Nicole, Allison, Megan, Lauren M., Lauren W., Olivia, Emma, Sophia...... for keeping me in game shape every week."Shotguns a beer I agree. Brady should retire tomorrow and get there at least on the same ballot.I mean that's assuming Brady makes it in.  He's kind of old now and doesn't have a ton more time to make his case.Aaaaand that's a wrap guys. Great thread, happy to have been a part of it. don't eat your lizardI don't know if you mean Deion or Barry and I don't think it matters.His playstyle caused his injuries. You can't have his dominance without the injuries he suffered. Heck, imagine if he stayed healthy AND Aaron Hernandez didn't turn out to be a serial killer? I can't imagine the Patriots losing a game, and I'm only being slightly hyperbolic.You can always guess at what would have been. Just grateful for what he gave this team. One hell of a career.okay how the fuckHe‚Äôs also got a goofy and fun personality. The man is quite a catch. She's definitely got the hips for a baby Gronk.Sweet baby jesus. Thats a woman who is going to birth baby to Gronk 2.5.Just fucked Edelman no lieThe standard is the standard.peak gronk is basically gronk whenever he‚Äôs not injured Gronk was damn near unstoppable out of his peakIIRC the Pats PPG without Edelman drops *way more* than it does without GronkBroooooThis probably added 3 years to Tom‚Äôs career to prove what he can do after 30 without Gronk. Time is just a construct, man. A fitness train? What an idea!He's being smart. The game can be addictive for those blessed with the talent to play it. At the same time, it can take away a man's body and mind.  I wish Gronk the best. He now has the time, energy, and money to follow his dreams. What's the cash prize for a suberbowl win again? He and his brothers also have that energy drink that got a deal on SharkTank. Still havent noticed it in stores, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs brought him a little to supplement his TiePaws money. You know, when I think about Old Man Gronk, I think about Slurms Mackenzie.  "I'm so... tired..."Or just throw 90% of his money into index funds and just collect on the capital gains and eventually buy a cruise ship and party forever on the open seas. Idk sounds like a Gronk thing to do. NiceAs a 60 year old... what's reddit?Gronk is player^2In his later years he was no longer the game breaker, but was still so massively deadly. The best blocking TE; while being massive passing threat. He was so good in opening the run game and to me where he was still so hyper deadly was if one other player was doing well the pats passing offense was unstoppable. KC game is the perfect example Jules, Gronk, Jules, Gronk. (Almost an iconic duo in pat game winning drives) Rams game finally double hard cover Jules and everyone else BOMB to Gronk.    Then if you do double coverage of them both someone else like Hogan wide open. Gronk just drew so MUCH attention to himself he just had to line up and two to three guys are on him by default. When he was out defenses seemed to be free to do so much more. The game plan with him on or off the field in games is night and day. No other TE changed the game he was in as much as Gronk did in his career. Like 5 straight years, your gameplan didn't matter against him. Besides the injuring him ones, I guess.... The other years, your gameplan could only make him like 20% less effective lol.Or not planned for, as a Steelers fan. Even then it hardly ever stopped him.[And sometimes there really wasn't!](https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/steelers-guard-rob-gronkowski.jpg)Same. I lost track of how many times I said :Who tf is supposed to be on Gronk?!  Dude was unstoppable.Or if he didn't play in Japan for so longSKIIIIEEEEEUUUUPPPPPJay Novachek has 3.I'd love to see Gronk roast the fuck out of Skip Bayless on UndisputedI don't think he redefined it but he embodied it. Like there was a picture of the ideal tight end but no one's ever really been able to check all the boxes til he came around.Take a look at Mike Ditka's first few years in a non passing era and 14 game seasons.  He was Gronk in an era where the concept of a receiving tight end never existed.  Rookie year - 56 catches for 1076 yards, 12 TDs, in 14 games.George KittleWhen the Pats were at their own 40 and on third down, you could always bet on a 12-yard Gronk post going another 35 to get them in the red zone.My go-to play back in those days. RB screen. Snap the ball sprint backwards cause nobody will catch Vick allowing blocks to set up, and then throw to McCoy. Easy 20 yards.Alex Smith finished like 18th in td passes that season. There were 14 starting qbs who had less pass tds than the guy who didn't have a single wr catch a td.Wasn't Bowe like really good for a few years?I forgot about Dwayne Bowe lmaoooo69[I bring gifts](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UntimelyInnocentGreatdane-max-1mb.gif)The search continues!  Aside: what happened to those best gifs of the season threads where people voted and shit, they were great.  _walks tom brady like a dog_Not what I was expecting. Gave me a great laughThis was Wrestlemania, and Gronk attended and was in the first row. Earlier in the show, one of the wrestlers had been shit talking Gronk and getting up in his face. Eventually, gronk decided he had had enough and jumped the barrier to join in on the action.  The thing is, this was all planned by the show runners. The plan was to make it seem like Gronk just got so pissed that he jumped the barrier and wrestled the main guy. The "refs" at the event were supposed to come over and act like "oh no, you can't do that!" whilst actually letting him get onstage and wrestle.  BUT, the people in charge forgot to tell the actual security lady, whose job it was to not let any rambunctious fans disrupt the show. So, as soon as she saw Gronk looking like a 6'6", 268 lbs rambunctious fan trying to disrupt the show, she rushed over to put a stop to that, without *any* hesitation.  The refs quickly pulled her aside after her bizarelly strong shove to tell her "wait, this is actually supposed to happen" and eventually Gronk got on stage and did his thing anyways. But, it was still hilarious/badass that this relatively tiny security guard took on the greatest TE of all time without any fear, all because someone forgot to tell her what was going to happen. My exact reaction when I saw the news pop up on my phone was ‚Äúoh yeaooooohhh.‚Äù Total nightmare on the field and made every play hell for us, but I‚Äôll miss the guy.[Iconic] (https://imgur.com/a/dbXMMfv)I‚Äôll never forget when he bounced that Colts player out of the club. I‚Äôm pretty sure my hs line coach and coaches all over the nation blew their load over the perfect drive blockYou're absolutely right, it doesn't get enough credit. Any time I watch a Pats game I get to see Gronk absolutely flatten a LB or DB on a run when he's pulling and it's always amazing. Such an important aspect in his game that makes him the weapon he is He 100% enjoyed it, probably just as much as catching passes. There's plenty of videos of him coming off the field after making a block and he's so fired up. Belichick has even talked about it, saying that's his favorite quality about Gronk. ‚ÄúWelcome back to Talk Is Jericho‚ÄùNo but My body is ready. Send some links Link pleaseDid she dump you to have a threesome with them or did you dump her because she had a threesome with them?Why is she your ex?I can't wait to smell itI see that going down kind of like this  https://youtu.be/CKFMvSy2-Qc?t=85Emmanuel.What about Bob?YesThat and all the kamikaze hits. Or if defenders were held to the same standard for pass interference against him or any standard at all.Seriously, how does one do this? Go through years of comments to find one relevant over.  Or maybe the better question is why?Or grown Gronk. Guh'dayumSo much to proveI tried to put fitness training chain but it ended up coming out as train, but whatever, it still works. Could you imagine if Gronkowski put together a destination vacation trip where you ride on a train from Boston to Florida, just working out with him and partying the whole way through? I mean, he did already have a cruise vacation trip. Shit would be nuts.I'll save you the only way I know how, by partying!  Party on GronkWhen I think about Gronk, I think about Smart Gronk.  Despite his golden retriever-ness, he has made some smart decisions and I think this is one of them.  I also think it has helped him to have a solid and supportive family.  As a 70 year old, wait...what was I doing again???"Hey, see that massive dude with the goofy grin over there? Forget about him."  "What? We're not covering him at all?"  "Correct."  "We're just going to let him do whatever he wants?"  "That's right."  "But then he'll score a ton of TDs."  "Yup."  "Then we'll lose the game!"  "¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"That was our defensive strategy!  Now not covering Gronk will work!It‚Äôs a bold strategy cotton. Let‚Äôs see if it pays off Honestly, the way Gronk ran all over us, it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference if someone was there or notOr if he didn‚Äôt retire twice after winning the championship Where is u/ScreamingSkipBaylessHas he ever roasted anyone? Dude seems way too cool. He'd probably just instantly be his broYeah, I agree.  Antonio Gates is probably the guy you could say redefined the position, Gronk is like the end result.That's a fair assessment.I'm interested to see what he can do with Jimmy G this season.I'm waiting for George Kittle to start talking about Gronk the way every safety today talks about Sean Taylor.Praise JamaalThat's like scoreagami for records. I want more.I remember people using that as proof that Smith was a shitty qb.   As a Smith defender, it made me wanna punch myself in the face. 6969696969Ofc you showed that play against the colts lmaoOMG that is soooo awesome!! I love hearing these kind of stories, and thank you for explaining the tiniest detail! As for that security lady, my god does she have some balls... she's my idol.   Watching it again, its quite funny how even Gronk is like flabbergasted when she runs over and pushes him back into the seats lol. He didn't even put up a fight lolMy reaction too, as a Raider fan. Absolute monster to defend, but entertaining as hell.Begs the question. Is there a more universally liked player?   Fitz maybe? I am not gonna click that link.There a video of this? So many DBs made business decisions when he was run blocking. Camille Kostek He dumped her cause she didnt invite him to make it a foursome with GronkWe were together for almost 5 years, sometimes people grow apart.> I can't wait to feel it  Colonel. Reggie.Colonel> always injured  > completely transformed his team when he was able to play  Bob might actually be the best comparison.Wow what a a fucking name drop.  Bob Sanders. He was such a good safety then just disappeared That too[Seems legit](http://media.masslive.com/patriots/photo/bzahgv2igaasiwvjpg-590f45fb5f9187f1.jpg)Somebody hire this guy!Leave it to a Bills fan to come up with the best party idea. The rest of the NFL base loves you crazy bastardsYo soy fiestaWhen its 90 degrees outside and I need my sweater. Brady likes to throw passes in small windows. Maybe he won't even look if the window is wide open. Spoiler alert it doesn't.Shannon ‚ÄúNot Very‚Äù Sharpe is one of the most **Overhyped** and **Overrated** Tight Ends this league has ever seen. The conspiracy of the media to fail to admit the greatness of Jason Written as the greatest Tight End in the *history* of the NFL is simply maddening!Shannon Sharpe That's pretty dark.also Deanthony Thomas was listed as a rb not wr that yearThe craziest thing was that towards the end of the season, a WR fumbled at the goal line and it was immediately recovered for a TD by a tight end.The fact that team was 9-7 and had an outside shot at the playoffs was incredible 6969696969Well to be fair it's the first explosion play that came to mind. I just mostly like the spike explosionWonder if Gronk thought that might have been part of it as well and that was something *he* wasn't told about.I'm glad to see people saying he's universally liked. I thought a lot of people would have turned on him after he went full WWE on TreDavious White[https://youtu.be/JqgJOcGCjk8](https://youtu.be/JqgJOcGCjk8) Can't say I wouldn't do the same tbh. Not like Gronk is gonna let you make the tackle so you may as well just remove yourself from the play lol  "Yea don't worry Gronk, I'm leaving I'm leaving"Jesus. That girl is a 10...:(Found Kelvin Benjamin's account It‚Äôs pronounced Cornell! And it‚Äôs the highest rank in the Ivy League!DONDODATSKEEEUUUPKellen Winslow Sr.Thing with both of them is they weren‚Äôt the ideal guy. They showed you a picture of what the ideal guy could be, but they couldn‚Äôt run like Gronk. Hell, I‚Äôd feel comfortable saying neither of those guys could block or catch like Gronk either, I‚Äôve seen Gronk make Julio-esque catches (except in the endzone) and I‚Äôve seen him handle premier edge rushers. The guy was everything you dreamed of at TE. Definitely wasn‚Äôt the first guy to block and catch, though.696969A permanent file in the spank bank. Yeah that might legitimately be the most attractive person I've ever seen lmao. Go Gronk69696969696969696969
r/nfl,If we analyze the [halftime show shot in which Big Boi drove onto the field](https://i.imgur.com/7VJUlhG.png), we see Big Boi roughly park at the 48. Big Boi entered from the same side of the 50 he parked at, meaning Big Boi did not in fact exit Big Boi territory before punting to Adam Levine (AL).  Now, on to the meaty stats:  First Half:  1. **LA Punt at LA 25 to NE** 2. LA Punt at NE 47 to NE 3. **LA Punt at LA 9 to NE** 4. LA Punt at NE 49 to NE 5. **LA Punt at LA 39 to NE** 6. **LA Punt at LA 40 to NE**  **Big Boi Punt at BB 48 to AL**  Second Half:  1. **LA Punt at LA 46 to NE** 2. **LA Punt at LA 6 to NE** 3. LA Field Goal at NE 26 4. **LA Punt at LA 30 to NE** 5. LA Pick at NE 27 6. LA Field Goal at NE 30  The Rams crossed their own 48 yard line on only 5/12 drives. Therefore, Big Boi drove further downfield in his own territory than the Rams on 7/12, or 58%, of his drives.  Big Boi > McVay SB Nation [picked this up](https://twitter.com/SBNation/status/1092871481191686144?s=19), although /u/plokijuh1229 is now the alias known as "patriots"This is peak offseason and it hasn‚Äôt been 24 hours Fun fact: [thats my grandpa‚Äôs car](https://imgur.com/a/J4B5TGH)  He got paid $2k for it, but couldn‚Äôt get tickets to the game.

He could have at least dialed up a few plays in a Miata to get some of the pressure off him. not fair, he had a car.  haven't you seen what happens in that tecmo ball ad?This is the one right here Now I want gold, just so I can give it to this.Why did I open this threadLol that SB Nation [turned your post into an article](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2019/2/5/18212078/big-boi-more-yards-than-rams-super-bowl) and cited your name as "Patriots" .....  &#x200B;  You would think they would understand how the site works first before they lift stories directly from Reddit.Interesting how Reddit decides what is a shitpost and what isn't./r/TheyDidTheMath?This is the greatest thing I've ever seen about the Super Bowl.Fuck TB and the Patriots.Oof SabermetricsNow this is the kind of advanced statistical work that I come here forIt‚Äôs Man VS Car.

Now this is advanced stats.Brutal, savage, rekt **BIG BOI**This is the exact type of shitpost we needThese are the gems that I come to reddit for. This is the content I have come to expect in the offseason. Quality shit post against the rams, 10/10.You just hate to see that. Big Boi to the Rams?!?It's not the Ram's fault that the refs were letting the Pats HODL on both sides of the ball.   I didn't have a team to root for, so I tried to watch it objectively. That's why the Saints weren't even there.   Drew Brees isn't getting held to 3 points. I don't Nick Foles is, either.   The League picked the perfect opponent for New England. A young team, quarterback, AND coach.  I think it was the lowest rated Super Bowl in history because the jig is up, and the fix is increasingly more obvious.   The Eagles weren't supposed to win last year, either. BDN and Papa Pederson weren't leaving anything on that field, and the owners were mad that their President ended up getting snubbed, and they didn't get the free publicity that they wanted.  I bet they really heard about it down at the Country Club ALL SPRING & SUMMER.   Well I'll see you boys on the frontthe offseason just started>meaty stats  more like sweaty, everyone in that show seemed moist.This was better than watching the SuperbowlWe're witnessing history I would like to welcome everyone to the 2019 NFL Offseason!OOFCadillac on the fieldlol ownedLets the shit posting begin!!Sleepy Brown was the big winner last night. man, it's really offseason alreadyThis is why we f5?

WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS.Love this so hard.this is epic lolDid Big Boi get closer to TB12 than Suh?  Will TB12 have a career longer than Maroon 5?  What is the WAG hotness factor of the Pats vs. Rams?  Is Atlanta's stadium uglier than the Birds Nest?    These are all questions we need answered.  where was weezer though?This is why we f5> meaning Big Boi did not in fact exit Big Boi territory  lmaoReady for action‚Äînip it in the budI love Big BoiThis is what I'm here forThe halftime show should have had sweet victory if it was there you would not be in the middle of a shit shower I only clicked this to find out who Big Boi is. Is that really McVay's nickname? Does anyone actually call him that? I want to believe it's an insulting label. But I honestly don't know. Yesterday I found out there was some kind of celebrity guy in Europe known as Pewder Pie. This is as real grown upthat refers to himself as that.Haha, it's funny because he wasn't playing in the game.Hmmm i could‚Äôve sworn i seen this on NFL memes account DREW BREES WOULD HAVE DRIVEN FURTHER THAN BIG BOI CHANGE MY MINDYikesIt's officially the off seasonStupid stat. He had no defensive pressurethat is so sad holy crap i am cracking upWait, that‚Äôs right... how did they let a car into the field to affect the turf???Big if trueUNSUBSCRIBE Yeah but he didn't have defense working against him did he?Travis and Maroon 5.....trash.   A Andre guest appearance would‚Äôve been dope This. Is. Amazing. I love the offseason.This is the type of next gen analysis that keeps me subscribed to this sub.Now this is a fucking stat!  Nice job, internet!ESPN Headline tomorrow: "On going story: Big Boi in line for new Ram's HC job after Super Bowl flop, per sources say"Rams just shoulda gone goatsFeelsGoodMan ClapNext level shit post.  10/10rams badSUBSCRIBEWell, the Speakerboxxx bass vibrates the tags so much that it propels the car forward in motion much more than measly acceleration or Jared Goff would be able to do, and the Rams had none of the speakerboxxx bass in any of their drives down field. Hitting the offseason full stride I see Is that cj Anderson's nickname?Big Boi's assistant now interviewing for head coaching job.Mods pls don't delete this[deleted]#N E X T G E N S T A T SNah peak offseason is still set to be Derek Carr vs Stephen A Hell in a Cell match.We haven't even begun to peakI, for one, welcome the shitting on the Rams after that performance.Off-season? This is peak r/nflAnd it' all downhill from here.This is definitely why I come to /r/nfl during the offseason.For everyone except the Patriots it's been 15 days tho.Nah, this is still the Super Bowl post-mortem. It's just there's a lot to break down in how poorly the Rams did.  Fun fact: this game was the lowest score the Patriots held any team to this year tied with the Jets at home game then at Buffalo where the Bills scored 6.  Another fun fact: until the Super Bowl, the Patriots hadn't won a game this year when their opponent was able to hold them to 20 or fewer points.Is this the only thread you posted this in? I‚Äôd be spamming that shit everywhere. Very coolLove the dude hoping someone records the Super Bowl halftime show loldamn respect for not showing that off everywhere bc thats so sickWell that's the most reddit thing I've seen all week. This was the best part of the super bowl, thank you for allowing me to relive Outkast for one moment.your album on that old post seems to be gone.   Edit: also big boi got a free caddy because of it. Tell your grandpa to contact Cadillac and see what they'll give y'all. Exposure was easily worth couple of millions for them. Best part is you‚Äôre a Titans fan in Atlanta.Adam Levine was wearing my sister's underwear Bro I literally cheered when I saw Big Boi roll up in your grandpa's black Lac. Such an ATL thing to do and classic outkast move.   On a personal note, Outkast was a big influence on me as a kid and was partly responsible for my Cadillac purchases.   When I was  a kid listening to Southernplayalisticfunkycadillacmuzik and 2 Dope Boys in a Cadillac, Elevators, as well as the rest of catalog of bangers they had mentioning cadillac, as a kid I told myself one day I'm gonna get one. I ended up getting 2.   Nothing compares to floating down the street in a classic Lac, bumping Outkast and pulling up to the gas station and literally *someone* making a comment on your car or trying to buy it off you, or just vibin out on your music as you post up for a bit. I'd get comments seriously like 80% I got gas.   I was hella happy to see Big Boi was in the halftime show, waited impatiently for the rest of performers to get down with their shit, and then when Big Boi finally rolls up in the Deville I lost it.   *The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sacks*  *The n#gga that like them Cadillacs*  *I stay down with these streets*  *Cause these streets is where my folks at* That is awesome! Beautiful car! Hope somebody recorded ;)I can't believe your grandpa owns that many beautiful pieces of American automotive history and then also chose to buy a Plymouth Prowler lmao. Really an awesome car collection though! Man that‚Äôs a sick collection of cars! I‚Äôm just curious, what did he do for a living back in the day to afford all those? Is your grandpa accepting applications for new grandchildren?  I want to live in that garage.That Caddy was the highlight of the halftime show. As soon as I saw that grill, I though, "damn, Big Boi knows how to make an entrance!"How does your grandpa feel knowing his car was better that Rams?I'll give him the only 2k I got for that beautiful pony Op's dad is looooooaaaaaded.Holy shit that thunderbird! I don‚Äôt know much about cars in general, but I love that babyMan, that car collection is sick. You got any pics of him riding in them? Dude must feel a truly profound sense of accomplishment with that kind of retirement hobby.My grandfather also has a 58 impala (black) that has forever been his crown jewel. He passed away recently and it was cool to see someone with such an expansive car collection admire that beauty as much as he did.>hope someone records this  >super bowl  Yeah, I think we got that covered.Hello fellow Hendersonvillian If your grandpa said u/issue you get to pick one of my cars and it'd yours, which would you pick? Also, make sure there's enough room in the trunk for all your mayo. Your grandpa has awesome tasteThis fact is fun as hell and your granddad's car is ballin. What is it? Looks like some 70s Cadillac. I am only into Japanese and german cars so I really don't know unfortunately.My grandfather also has a 58 impala (black) that has forever been his crown jewel. He passed away recently and it was cool to see someone with such an expansive car collection admire that beauty as much as he did.ImpressiveHow did they get in contact/find out about your grandpa's collection?Gahhhh! What an awesome collection!Shit's dope!  Smashville represent! Your grandpa has a seriously awesome college of vintage Americana!  Bonus points for fixing most of them up, too!Is your grandpa accepting applications for new grandchildren?This is awesome. Did your grandfather get to meet Big Boi? [deleted]wait. He sold it to the NFL for 2k, or just rented it to them for 2k?My grandfather's 1929 Model T was used in a major road opening a few years back and it was in full color in all the local papers. That was a cool experience.They would have dropped Bombs over Baghdad I would have  liked it if they hit the casuals at home with a quick 8 minute performance of Spottieottiedopalicious I wish Big Boi and Andre 3-stacks would get back together for preferably an album, but I'd take a tour... or anything. OutKast will forever be my go to hip hop selection. Southernplayalistic, ATLiens and Aquemini are three of the best hip hop albums to ever drop.   I still remember back when I was in high school, OutKast was the only rap music that my dad wouldn't turn off when riding in my car. I found that to be a huge testament to their talents, as my dad genuinely enjoyed a lot of their music. SpottieOttieDopalicious, Player's Ball and Elevators were his top 3 hahaThey would still be going if Andre was there.Alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright CJ Anderson the real Big BoiTrent Brown is heavier than a silverback gorillaI can't wait for Football for another Six Months.

We‚Äôre glad to have you.Well then let me be the first to ask.... What kind of sandwich is your teams QB? Welcome to the motherfucking shitposting show.  You‚Äôve got a long road ahead of you.  If you're feeling in the mood, young fella, we'd love to have you in r/NBA Welcome, friend!At least you're not a rams fan! *looks at /r/nfl front page, sees about half of the posts being from Patriots fans*....yup :/That game came straight from the toilet store Sweet victory > Marroon 5It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside üòÇü§£üò¢üò≠Think of how much better that halftime show would have been if it had been old school Outkast instead. Big Boi was the best partTo be fair, he has a better track record at slingin the rock than Goff doesIt's impossible to feel pressure twistin Daytons in a black Lac.  This is a scientific fact.  Goff would have came a long way like them slim ass cigarettes from Virginia. This shit won't stop so he just gon' continiaDamn how did they mess that up that bad lol. They thought my flair is my username. Still cool though.God dammit I have lived about 6 glorious months without seeing that stupid link in a thread and now you ruined it on Offseason Day 1. At least no one has yet monstered and graveyarded your comment.LeSabremetricsThis is the content I have come to expect ~~in the offseason.~~I mean fixed? You think Kyle Shannihan somehow gave the Patriots the opportunity to take a Superbowl to overtime? You must be crazy. If you're claiming I copied them, then that's definitely not true. [I made the claim jokingly in the reddit game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/amwa81/super_bowl_liii_game_thread_new_england_patriots/efp52hv) halftime before checking the actual stats behind it later.[I don't think so bud](https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/drew-brees-valentines-day-gas-tank-twitter.jpg)Go listen to southernplayalisticadillacmuzik again. No disrespect to Dre, but Big Boi is every bit as responsible for their early shit, their best shit.**BROUGHT TO YOU BY**  #I N T E L  *insert useless 360 camera view while the game is paused for no reason*I want that so bad. I will buy a Derek Carr jersey if he keeps this shit up. No lie. Y'know I seen Screamin A Smith on my wife's soap opera the other day.  It was awfulI‚Äôll pay $100 PPV for thatWhen we peak, all of Philadelphia will know it!Yeah this is it, I don‚Äôt even know what subs I‚Äôd post about it in though hahah. It is pretty cool though, we imagine the value went up quite a bit after last night (hopefully)This is not the comment I was expecting to find after scrolling this far down. Very cool is accurate.

I have tried so many times to get him to buy some JDM but the only thing he has is a 300ZX twin turbo. Hopefully one day he will cop a Supra or RX7My Grandpa has a friend whose job is to find cars for commercials/music videos/media performances and I think he just told him they were looking for an old Caddy for Big Boi. His other cars have been in quite a few music videos, but I can‚Äôt remember which ones. Mostly country (due to living in Nashville lol)Pretty sure it was 2K to rent it for the showRented. No one would sell a mint condition Cadillac for 2kThey paid him 2k to rent it for the halftime showBut is Japan still bringing PlayStations?But they'd be sitting in a drop top, soakin wet.Need to go old school in their hometown and play ‚ÄúPlayer‚Äôs Ball‚Äù. > a quick 8 minute performance of Spottieottiedopalicious   That song's like a poem.   Outkast is one of the most underrated names in hip hop history. Them and Goodie Mob changed the game for southern hip hop.   Too many bangers to list   It's not even like they split off or anything. They hang out and play golf and shit regularlySaw them at Firefly Music Festival in 2014 for their one-off reunion tour. Best rap concert I've ever seen and still super thankful that I wentI saw them together at ATLast a couple of years back.  It was fantastic, and the energy was good...but Andre just didn't seem the same anymore.  He certainly gave it his all while performing but it just kind of seems like he was going through the paces in between and there certainly wasn't that old soul it used to have back in the day.  Perhaps that just comes with life progressing as we all do, who knows.  I was just happy to see them on stage together again.  Big Boi was full of energy and made it super fun though, as he always does.I saw them in college during their stanklove tour, Ludacris was the opener, easily my favorite hip hop show I've been tooDanny shelton*Big if true! Patriots just put a jersey on a brick wallThere's the AAF at least. It'll serve as our methadone till at least MayWhat do you mean dude? We are 4 Monday‚Äôs away from watching the offensive lineman run the 40 at the combine Wow that‚Äôs hilarious.,, imagine if they played Andre 3000 Nipples 2Songs About Jane at the latest. I stand by my opinion that that isn't a horrible album. Everything since then has been Adam Levine and the instrument toting backup dancers.Solid analysis. Very apt.FLASH 2020: High ExpectationsWhy would our lord and savior downgrade to just president?Not sure but it has like 20 ingredients.

Grilled cheese is also one of my favorites, but out of respect to Packers fans, giving them the cheese-based sandwich seems fair.I dunno, what's the handsome sandwich that is still kind of unproven?Stay away, he's ours.Is anyone?Oh yeah?

If a team's quarterback never gets dirty, and their receivers can run free, most of the teams in the NFL can score at will.  That's why it seems that Ownership-friendly players always seem to catch all the breaks, and end up deep in the playoffs, year after year.Say no more, you should get your credit for itHahaha, never seen that, but the fun police are out in full force.I was listening to that album after the super bowl and the production holds up shockingly well for the most part.

Started off as a magic show and then cut halfway into one of the mid 90s superbowls (where broncos beat the packers). Always begins with an Antonio Freeman touchdown catch and id ALWAYS be rooting for the packers and goddamn it they never won. Sucks cause they‚Äôre winning when it first cuts over. Been at least twenty years since i watched that but I remember it so wellI got implied verbal consent.*psst* hey, wanna be a head coach Always missing Andre 3000To be fair, we all know [what happened last time they had a reunion...](https://youtu.be/02cSc5a49LA)it doesn't.

So is that 50s blue Chevy Bel-Aire.I‚Äôm actually in Nashville but either way, it isn‚Äôt easy being a Titans fanYeah like those Tampa fans amiriteAt least we aren't New OrleansHe likes weird cars, he also has a Chevy SSR (which my family insists is the ugliest thing in his garage but he loves it)He's not a Japanese car guy at all, I take it? Which, by the way, is still a great deal.Better be a household name Riggity Row is coming!Sell some medicine bitches!You might speak 16 languages, but you gonna need it when you in Times Square selling fake hatsOutKast is definitely not underrated. Maybe teens don't really know them, but anyone with knowledge of hip hop history properly rates them.It is a poem, spoken word to be exact Not to mention that they do still tour every now and then.I used to desperately want them to get back together, but I read an interview by Andre and realized he has absolutely no interest in being a rapper anymore. He is just a really eccentric guy and he felt he got all he could from rapping by the time he was in his late 20s/early 30s. He actually spoke about that reunion concert and said he felt like he was selling out just doing that.Tent BrownAnd made the Rams pay for it I'm so excited for AAF! When's the first game?Forge On! Can you order F5 keys in bulk? Andr√© 3000 only likes Australian Rules Football because he's quirky as fuck.That's why they played 3 songs from the album last night even though it's over 15 years old. It's a great album> I stand by my opinion that that isn't a horrible album  Coldest take of the day, that album was an absolute classic.They had five people up through their fourth album, Overexposed.  Then 6 for V, and 7 for Red Pill Blues (new one).  Not sure what they‚Äôre doing really with these people, because every album to me seems like they LOSE a member and it‚Äôs just increasingly Adam Levine, but they just keep adding, I guess.Um, Songs About Jane is goddamn masterpiece. One of the best albums of the 00s*SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE*This man can handle the highest office in the landCommander-in-KiefYou guys had a sandwich but you kept picking it up and dropping it.

ThanksThis is different than Arena FootballNo, you are, but it's just nowhere near a great album. If someone thinks it's an absolute classic, it just shows their ignorance on the art form. It's like if someone claims Transformers is an absolute classic, they probably don't know too much about film. Wholesome camaraderie from /u/ThroatYogurt69...Didn't put up a competitive game?  It was a close game for 3.5 quarters.  The Rams defense kept the Pats to just 3 points.  I agree that the Rams offense was trash, but that game was winnable. I expected that one. Watching the late hits and defensive holdings that the Rams got away with against Steve McNair's Titans, I knew it had to be highly managed.  The League isn't rigged, per se,v but the Owners, their refs, and their choices of broadcasters DEFINITELY have clear biases(e.g. Collingsworth & Buck), and it obviously impacts the games imo.can you put a t-pose beside my usernameThose are hilarious.

r/nfl, That decision not to give zeke the ball on 1st or 2nd and goal at the 2 is so insanely dumb.

I thought the turnovers were my brain looping but nope. We got trounced.We would've gotten destroyed immediately if we got in. Our offense sucks.Christmas Eve, 2017. The game is over. The players fill the field and exchange pleasantries and jerseys in a show of sportsmanship, sweat dripping from every pore. But all attention is on one pair of rivals: the kickers. Time seems to slow to a crawl as their eyes meet. They approach one another, adrenaline still pumping hard, and embrace tightly as the two sides of relief and disappointment come to a dizzying blend.

You watch the Falcons lose, the Lions lose.    You start to snicker as your Doritos crumbs slide smoothly down your pencil moustache. You shout WE DEM BOYZ as Zeke takes the field for the first time in 6 weeks, drinking Tecate because "That's a real Texas beer." It clearly isn't, you've never been, but your uncle went to San Antonio for a business meeting once. You watch your boys take the field and then lay the biggest egg on national television this week, at home, on Christmas Eve.    You weep silently as you take off your Dez jersey to reveal a fresh Curry jersey underneath. You force yourself to smile knowing the NBA playoffs start any day now.Thank God, I hate having expectations.

What an overrated piece of garbage this loser is.If only Sean Lee was pla... oh wait Absolutely terrible coaching and QB play.

Glad to have you.The only reason I'm upset the Cowboys lost tonight is that I wont be able to see them lost next week in person.wacky times we live in...

[Try this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/5vjpln/dallas_cowboys_are_the_team_to_beat_in_the_nfc_in/de2ta83/)  /r/Cowboys is a trash Sub.We were elimated when Dez fumbled. GG.I could not agree more.They took a play out of Pete Carroll's playbook there. Jason Garrett doesn‚Äôt want to ruin his 8-8 consistency. Anyone else getting de ja vu?Linehan should be fired for that. Out of a cannon. Into the sun. I was happy as someone playing against Zeke in fantasy championship gameInb4 the whole coaching regime gets contract extensions They forgot he wasn‚Äôt suspended anymore.Yea WTF was going on there. Were you guys doing some crazy defensive trickery or something to psyche out our coaching staff? I'm still scratching my head....I hope linehan gets firedDon't try to understand Linehans play calling, you'll get a headache He was on the field, they just didn't give him the ball.Our offensive coordinator threw right at this moment.Zeke was probably having flashbacks from the Ohio state game against Michigan state in 2015. When that penalty happened, I thought, "oh well, they'll just give it to Zeke a few times. There's 7 points on the board for sure." We deserved to lose at that point. You guys played a good game. Good luck going forward. Wilson is exciting to watch. Linehan and logic don't mesh.We‚Äôllüëègetüëèthemüëènextüëèseason üëèboysüëènowüëèwhoüëèwantsüëèaüëèfrostyüëèmilkshake?üëè...........üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèThe self-roast.  I like it.  Good on you for having a sense of humor.  Too many folks in here with their football team the only thing they seem to have in life (not this thread, but lord--you should see some of our fans when we go down by 10 points.  It's like the world is ending.  Fucking annoying). The clapper!That fumble and interception he caused was definitely exciting, imagine if he never got the ball thrown to him, that wouldn‚Äôt have happened[deleted]oh he will love the target on his back he'll have all summerAfter the Packers/Cowboys game earlier this year I texted my former roommate and Packers friend, "see you in the playoffs."  ^^^^I'll ^^^^see ^^^^you ^^^^all ^^^^in ^^^^hell ^^^^nowSo perfectI should have typed it after Linehan called shotgun passes on 1st and 2nd & Goal at the 3 and 2. Could have posted it after the first miss. [/r/NFL threads about the Cowboys in a nutshell](https://i.imgur.com/VyVo058.png)Every Cowboys related thread has more Eagles flair than any other. We had to listen to a lot of Dak > Wentz talk last off-season. We have a lot of bottled up hate....problem?I was told there would be Dallas tearsThe NFC east is full of joy He has consistently been a 4-12 caliber coach with a 12-4 caliber team so the obvious result is 8-8.Honest question, how is he still there? Minus last year's 13-3 he is 53-50 in 8 seasons. He also seems to never make adjustments. Is it just that Jerry likes a yes man?At least you're playing for something next week....Underrated commentIt's not so much that your defense progressed. Our offense is just that bad.If you count the TD pass Dak threw to Seattle's Justin Coleman today, they're tied.That *IS* a fun fact!That is actually pretty coolDan has thrown a touchdown more recently than Wentz  It was to Seattle but stillMy Facebook post. I gave props doe.Yup, Wentz is a good QB. The Romo stan in me is loving how god awful Dak has been. The Cowboys fan in me is not.Even I can get behind thisFun Facts 2, 3, 4, and 5:  Deshaun Watson has started 7 games in his career.  He has thrown for 400+ yards once, and 4+ TDs three times.  He passed for 19 TDs (in 7 games).  Dak has started 32 games in his career.  He has thrown for 400 yards zero times.  He has thrown for 4 TDs zero times.  In 2017, he passed for 21 TDs (in 15 games).He's also thrown the same number of TD passes at Lambeau as Hundley hasDid he play with a torn ACL?Actually your wrong.   He threw a pick six to a Seahawk player tonight..You too?  I've never been so sick.  Literally thought I was going to die last night. Definitely. But I'd rather lose in the playoffs than not be there at all :/After this game, I can see why people say Dez didn't catch itYou mean deztroyed?Welcome to the clubWell, these are my thoughts exactly if by some miracle the Falcons lose next week.Maybe they‚Äôll have a baby that can kick down the middleDelete this!I remember pops saying "Just like Walsh!" and correcting him that Walsh misses left. Glad it's not just me.!redditsilveri wanted a nintendo switch for xmas, instead I got Faded :'(We‚Äôll get em next year. Maybe.Welcome to the club. We have plenty of alcohol.Disrespected a legend for the rookie hot hand. We are reaping what we sow. I do. And then jerked over Garrett because he won Coach of the Year. Jesus how fuckin dumb could that be? I was calling it all last season. Nope. They didn't want to fuckin listen.Especially when Romo was all "my mind has finally caught up to my body" or whatever.   Dude knew his football. I will always have a place in my YouTube playlist for his highlights.Such a cool wordShould‚Äôve went with Garropalo The offense played? Huh, I must've missed that :/ FLakers are up and comingI have a cowboy fan friend who's a Yankee, unc, LeBron fan and he doesn't even believe that he's a bandwagon fan. Seriously. It‚Äôs Christmas man how dare youDo the Cowboys still have bandwagon fans? I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre all Pats fans now. I absolutely love this whole chain of replies <3   Ferrari might have a great season in 2018 as well! Lebron James upvoted your comment oh wow - you just murdered three fanbases - 30,000 middle aged men in Lakers jerseys have been found on their floor across the countryThe best part is this is coming from a Seahawks fan lolMan City welcomes all their new plastics.Damn, I hate winter breakThey can always go back and watch the 90s Chicago Bulls highlights51 yards after Q1, 97 after Q4We had the ball in the red zone WITH ZEKE! Didnt run it. America won today Ah yes, Christmas came early this year.When I say cowboys, you say suck!!

What playoffs.don't worry the CFP will squeeze them in somehowhttps://i.imgur.com/sAkmNAw.gifquality.Glad someone took the biggest egg of the week award away from the packers.I'm laughing so hard right now!This is art I'm a Cowboys fan outside of Dallas. Just spent good chunk of money to go to the game to watch this shit show and this comment was still funny. People need to chill.Christ. I‚Äôm a Cowboys fan and even I appreciate this comment. Imagine waking up in my apartment in the outskirts of dallas, barbecue sauce on my titties and this team that has told me for weeks that we will only be better when Zeke returns goes out and shits the bed..and then the tears of a thousand men flow from my eyes as I‚Äôve not been alive long enough to remember my team winning anything meaningful Nah those guys don't actually watch the games. They just bitch about Romo.Soooo many W‚Äôs I am pulling for you guys but I can't help but face the fact that the rams are going to lose in round one. I just feel it. The end of the tunnel should just be Zeke or Dez's face. God it sucks that that W is meaningless now.Lol this is so trueNot even close at this point.  Love, Steelers fans If Sean Lee was our coach...Hi SkipWell if Sean Lee played every game Romo probably wins a super bowl at some point, his injuries are part of the package.I swear I've heard this before...The final nail for me was not helping our back up left tackle against Atlanta. If we can't make the most obvious of fucking adjustments, seriously wtf are we doing here.You forgot Garrett.*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*Join us!I thought all last year the hype was fucking ridiculous, romo is/was infinitely better than dakHe's played 2 seasons....Well then let's all hope he lives forever Dilly dilly fellow bird bro, and a merriest of Christmases   to you and yours!!!My father being a cowboy fan, and myself being a Buc, this is how our football conversations have been since 2004 or so.Nah, we would have thrown a quick goal-line slant. The QB-choice play was a step up.Close threadTrust the process.EZ mistakeJason Garret studies the Seahawks defensive scheme  *Hmmm... I'd better turn up the clapping*Linehan just start clapping Garrett can go too.[deleted]Their whole fucking coaching staff needs to goEveryone does [insert Rick & Morty pasta]I‚Äôm sure the Seahawks would understand this decision.I'm seriously feeling like larrydavid.gif right now. On one hand, we miss the playoffs.. On the other, this likely means Garrett and Linehan are gone. I'm....(pause for emphasis)..... **WAY**..... more okay with the way this season ended than I was last year.https://imgur.com/varmemiYeah but then we wouldn't of seen 20 different angles of him sitting on the benchHe absolutely didn't cause the pick him reaching back for it is the only reason Earl wasn't picking it clean and taking it to the house.  Absolutely awful throw.  Fumble was on him but not the pick.I think I give him half blame on that pick, throw was awful. It annoyed me so much. This guy is a high profile veteran and he starting throwing a fit, NOT ONLY very early in the game, but while they were ahead.   He is supposed to be the guy rallying his team to perform better, not be a distraction and fumble when he finally gets the rockWe are all patriots fans in these blessed playoffs. If we can't be happy. No one can be happy What a fucking mystery that was. Totally irrationalExcuse me while I go put some more water in Zeke's momma's dish. What can I say about the Dallas Cowboys that hasn't already been said about Afghanistanhttps://i.imgur.com/uo6sz2D.gifvI'm proud of this. We shit on your team, our team, and yo mama's team."We came here, to call ya a choker" -Doug NastyThe Vikings of the NFCE We enjoy clowning you guys, but that's part of the rivalry. If we fall this post season, I wouldn't expect any less than other NFCE teams coming into the thread to talk trash.That's because we do a better job of hating your team than your fans do of representing it.Weve been drinking to put up with our in laws and dont play today what do you expect.That's the theory.  Garrett is a former Cowboys player and he doesn't seem to stir the pot too much within the organization.  It's frustrating to see the team come out of the locker room in the second half and not make any adjustments while the other team takes off.  It's been a common theme in every game the Cowboys have lost this season.  There isn't a ton of variation in play-calling (although some of that might be Scott Linehan's fault as offensive coordinator).  A lot of fans are ready for the team to try something new.He is in the running for COTY every year (clapper of the year)nah, in the middle portion of the season, Seahawks would have been able to convert every 3rd down, regardless the situation, and had at least 4 pass plays over 30 yardsIt's easy to throw TDs to your own teammates. That's what plays are designed to do.  Throwing TD passes to players not even on your team? Now that. *that.* That's skill.Well, Coleman WAS wide open.The funnest fact ü§ó>since tearing his ACL 3 weeks ago, Carson Wentz  Now that is *not* fun :(SubscribeDan is a kicker u silly gooseLt. Dan?![No worries man I stole it from a buddy who stole it from someone else on Reddit apparently.](https://i.imgur.com/AKTOlYX.mp4)It's fucking great, being able to enjoy Romo now. I've always known he's a good guy, but I was obligated to despise him. No longer!3 plays, one being a touchdown pass Ugh what the heck me too! I've been in bed all day it sucksAt least we get a better pick Wide low.NEPHEWIf you get one you should buy Xenoblade Chronicles 2. It's my personal game of the year and is my 2nd or 3rd favorite game I've ever played.My girlfriend got me a switch for christmas. Id rather be in the playoffsNot with Garrett coaching.Dan Bailey played at least. USucks for them that the Penguins are having a down year. Looks like they'll have to hope that the Blackhawks turn it aroundFor now they can watch the WarriorsI saw an old Kobe highlight from 2009 today and they cut to a fan in the crowd. He was wearing a Lakers colored Yankee cap. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. They're still Warriors fans for the next 4 years, they'll be alright. Cowboys gave had 2 good seasons in 20 years IDK how anyone can call cowboys fans bandwagon fans Happy Holidays, fam!Oh man do they. I don't hate Dallas fans per se, I hate Dallas fans from Philly. There's a fucking lot of them. They all came out of the woodwork last year.It's been Ferrari's year since 2010Kd down voted it 4 times Mind blowing play call. Right before that play i said to my dad "well zeke will just punch it in"Their team didn't. Christmas claps are my favorite kind of clapsPatriots and Seahawks fans are just really happy to be able to join in on hating a team for once.  >Guys they're partying with us over here!  I get it, don't worry. Fade my agape ass!SucküëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèI love our recent broness between birdsPlease doHonestly I wouldn‚Äôt hate the Cowboys as much if it wasn‚Äôt for Skip Bayless and some of the damn Cowboys fans who love Lakers+GSW+Yankees.   That and Chris Christie hahahaI was honestly expecting a Jason Garrett gifIt‚Äôs never a true collapse with a backup QBFirst playoff appearance since 2003. I am too fucking happy as well to be upset at a first round lossNaw, it should be Romo smiling.Sean Lee should buy the team. Who would win a fight? Sean Lee vs Witten?*THKIUUUP!Which is exactly why I hate relying on him. His highs are as high as anyone in the league, but the Marinelli D falls to pieces when he misses his annual 6 games.Hi Skip. Yes, but in my opinion Garrett is a symptom of Jerry.  With how intrusive Jerry is you're only gonna have yes-men coaches, and you chase away the good ones.Well remember Rus did the same thing....but in a super bowl, the Seahawks been kicking themselves too.But the holding penalty followed by a sack to take them out of the red zone was meta hawks footballEZ BIG EZ MISTAKE EZYou bastard that made me laughYes but what of the gum chewing?!Oh please oh please oh pleaseeeeeePrescott audibled out of the one call to a pass play, so...It worked for the Seahawks in the Superbowl....This is Zeke thread. I think you meant to post this in the Todd Gurley thread. Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  This Dallas coaching staff is perfect and I hope ol' Jerry signs them to lifetime deals.Marinelli worked wonders with a rookie secondary and our DL. I'm cool with everyone else getting the fuck out.To be fair, you need a very high IQ to understand Linehan. His playcalling is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of offensive technique, most of his playcalls will go over a typical fan's head.Too soon.Hate to break it to you man, but Garrett is almost certainly back next year. For the past two years I've speculated that Dez is over rated but, damn, that image proves it. Honestly, if the Cowboys drop Dez I wouldn't be mad.  He's extremely inconsistent. Honestly the 11 tds are impressive given the other stats are weak in comparisonAB is worth every penny of that 68M$https://i.imgur.com/fByX5CI.pngI remember 10ish years ago during a game (I wanna say his 1st MLS game?) there was a thing called Beckham Cam where a skycam and ground cameraman were solely dedicated to following David Beckham. He didn‚Äôt cause the pick, but as a professional starting number 1 WR in the NFL with arguably the strongest hands in the league, if you get your mitts on the ball, you have to come down with it. Not an easy catch, but they don‚Äôt pay him an average annual salary of 14 million just to make easy catches.it was a little behind but Dez still let it go through BOTH of his handsAny other receiver, yes. But we pay him too god damn much to have balls hit him in the hands and not be caught. He's being paid like a receiver who can handle bad passes like that. You can't blame him for the throw but you can't excuse someone paid like that to not catch themThat's darkü§îü§îEven Pete Carroll thought they should have run it.I, for one, love the Vikings and their fans. Watching all these teams that used to be good crumble apart feels majestic. Just wish injuries had not been the way a lot of it happened.NFCWeast?I would be with those fans wanting a change. However, the question if you fire Garrett is, do you trust Jerry to hire the right guy?This is why Eli will go into the HOF. First ballot. Skill.Y'all Eagles fans wild in here.Eagles fans easily the MVP /r/NFL roasters.Nick Foles:  Look at me  I'm the MVP nowNobody is original but at least we can all get good jokes Is it rebuild time yet? Obviously you have Dak and Zeke but ya‚Äôll need some more playmakers So... Blair Jr.?Too slowMaybe its time to dump/trade Dez. Please. Clappy McGee isn‚Äôt even in our top 5 problems this year. Man, I want you guys to get rid of Garrett. He's poisonous to all NFC East rivalries. CMan United are just up against a behemoth City team tooTheres always real madridIncorrect, bandwagon assholes don't care about hockey at all. I had a shithead boss in California who was a fan of the Lakers, Cowboys, and fucking Red Sox and didn't like hockey. He tried to buddy buddy me on the Red Sox and I was *not* having itMy ex called me a bandwagon Pittsburgh Pirates fan 2 years ago, so it could be worse.Merry Christmas. If you make it to the SB, run it on the 1. If you think that's bad, try the Lehigh valley All I can think of is the bookie from silver linings playbook and i hate that dude. There are a ton of them in DC too.  And Rochester, where I now live.  They only want to talk about football if their team is doing well or beat the Redskins, of course.[....like this guy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixs7jQzs07I) Even more in the D.C. area. It's sickening. Lol so the Seattle fan is complaining about a surge of fairweather fans? Are we sure they're bandwagoners, and not just long time fans who have been really sad since 96? Me too.  Edit: well, to myself, not my dad.http://i.imgur.com/RuByaAQ.gifCowboys Shit I'm friends with the Falcons after Morelli fucked them in the butt. I agree with everything you just said. I hate a lot of Cowboys fans too, but I still love the Cowboys, so what are you gonna do?I actually thought really hard about this. Witten all the way. 6'5" and 265 lbs. Plus I've seen some linebackers bounce off of him.You may have convinced me to reconsider Garrett. Good point!Nail on the head. Any coach that wants any control of the team(read that as every elite coach) can't coach for Jerry because they just butt heads over and over and they end up leaving or getting fired. Wade and Jason are both yes-men and that's exactly how Jerry wants it. In his mind, he knows best.Hawks football at least involves winning a divisional round this millennia.Pro Bowl caliber right now.Imagine the camera flashing between Garret and Carroll:  *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap*   *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew*   *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap*   *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew*   *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap*   *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew* *chew* Its not just one play. He isnt that great of a coach and im pretty much done with him. but the Rams actually use Gurleythis guy fucking gets itAnd yes, I do have a Dallas star tattoo, and no you can't see it ;)This was a bad season, but last season the Cowboys were 13-3. They also had their best player out for 6 games and another great player out for a couple as well. He can get away with this season. So you're saying there's a chance...Back in 2012 or 2013, I definitely thought Calvin Johnson, Dez Bryant, Julio Jones, and AJ Green were fighting for best WR in the NFL.He was much better with a QB that had chemistry with him. Dak just doesn't have a jump ball arm (or deep ball either). That is pretty much Dez's skill set. He can't run routes well, he's not faster than any DB, and he's more often than not going to be doubled or shadowed by a safety. His only saving grace is the 2 routes he can run decent and jump balls. Since Dak can't make the jump balls work (by not taking the chance most of the time) then he's left with like 2 routes that can be predictable. Listen to Jenkins (from the Giants) talk about breaking down covering Dez from last year.>For the past two years I've speculated that Dez is over rated but, damn, that image proves it. Honestly, if the Cowboys drop Dez I wouldn't be mad.  He's extremely inconsistent.   It's the Quarterbackthat's because of the type of player he is.  Dez is good in the red zone for a jumping TD catch. not usually putting up a lot of yards but lots of TDsNot arguing with the rest of your comment but he absolutely does not have the strongest hands in the league. He's big, physical, aggressive and will attack the ball but his hands are definitely not his strength./r/evilleageofevilRemember when we had Vikings legend Donovan McNabb as our QB? That was almost as good as when we had Vikings legend Sam Bradford.Well if you love watching teams crumble apart, stay tuned for the next Vikings playoff game. <3 you too buddyYou're fired again No. But he won't have that opportunity to hire the "right guy". He will not fire Garrett. Period. Jerry has become so obsessed with proving to the world that he's a "Football guy" that his first move was to fire a hall of fame coach in Landry. Then he hired Jimmy and won a couple of super bowls. Too bad everyone realized that it was Jimmy, not Jerry, who was the reason we won them. So what does he do? Fire Jimmy because he wasn't getting any credit. Then Barry Switzer comes in and wins a super bowl. Yay right? No. Still Jimmy's team and Jimmy was still getting the credit. Two season later, he's gone after working with Jerry to build their team- which sucked. We've been mediocre ever since because Jerry will not let anyone with any credibility run his team to take away from him. Parcells was a move to the contrary, but Parcells wouldn't be Jerry's yes-man and refused to defer credit to his boss. Naturally that relationship eroded, especially since Jerry's drafting and FA pick ups didn't put us anywhere near a super bowl caliber team. Now he has his guy. The guy who will always give credit to Jerry. 13-3, "I just was able to coach the team I was given." 4-12, "The team didn't mesh and the coaching staff couldn't work with the guys we had." Jerry gets all the credit and none of the blame under Garrett.  Now, Jerry is old. He looks at this team as his final chance to get a ring that he can claim as he's slowly giving more power to his son. You have the best line that's aging quickly. A HOF tight end nearing the end. An average-at-best "star" reciever being paid elite money for the next 3 years. He either has to blow that all up and shake up the coaching staff, or stick with his guys now and hope it falls into place. You have a team like this and get a new coach who wins a ring, who is everyone gonna praise? The owner or the new coach who got it all to work? Jerry has to stick with Garrett because its the only way he'll get the credit he craves. Jerry is one hell of an owner, but his hubris is killing usHis son has taken over a lot of the management and day-to-day stuff, and we're hopeful that he does a good job.  He is credited with talking Jerry out of drafting Johnny Football (thank god), and has been more active about talking about next year's picks (he wants to continue to focus on building up the defense).  I'm not sure if he'd get to pick the next HC by himself or if Jerry would get the final say.[r/eagles after Seahawks victory kneel](https://i.imgur.com/baWGNvT.gifv)We the wildest in the league Sh... people are shit talking people who ain't us.. just roll with it..We're terribly misunderstood.   We only throw snowballs out of love; trying to cool down those we've already burned wit' pure fire. We get a lot of practice when talking to fellow Eagles fans. It's pretty much second nature.Rebuild means blow everything up, so no.   We need to re-tool. Get some different players in, but not blow up the whole team Blair Bailey the 1sthttps://twitter.com/b3ntam/status/945081381868179456"hey league, want a 17 million dollar receiver on the decline who gets sulky on the sideline? Don't everyone raise your hand at once."Honestly from his performance today. Throwing a bitch fit then getting a ball punched out then int. He isn't worth what we pay him.Jerry Jones will do anything in his power to make sure that doesn't happen.K The Patriots?Alabama just made the top 4 this year Unfortunately for them Real were just defeated in El Clasico. The good news for them is that Barcelona just won El Clasico.United have won the league 20 times, the Cowboy's don't belong in the same conversation.  You mean Barcelona?He didn't even bandwagon the LA Kings when they won the cup?Someone called me a bandwagon Cavs fan once at the airport. I whipped out my Browns hat and Indians jersey from my luggage. They said "whatever" and walked away.   He was wearing a Yankees hat Likewise, if you get down to the 3 yard line, you might want to run it with Zeke.Seriously. I grew up there, it's unbelievable how many Dallas fans there are there.  Edit: I used the word "there" a whole bunch of times in one sentenceI'm 12 what is that> Lol so the Seattle fan is complaining about a surge of fairweather fans?  Allow me.  I live in the DC metro area. There are more Cowboys fans then skins fans. Actually, to be fair, it goes like this in fan population 1)Cowboys - never been to Dallas 2) Steelers - Gotta get out of Shittsburg 3) Skins.   As a Vikings fan we are really the only ones who can judge...us and the Browns fans.Ive never seen mouse movements so angryAh r/dota2 leaks againThis is amazing. Will save it for future use fam.rtzWSuckSuck :-(deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9109  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/03772)Sure you don't want Eagles flair?But who replaces him? As long as there's talk of Jeff Fisher returning to coaching, I'm too scared to deal with a vacancy.Yeah, I'd call 150+ in the air and 100+ on the ground leveraging your assets Listening to Jerry's comments this year, it's clear he places most of the blame for this season on the Zeke suspension, and that he still trusts Garrett. I agree. I think that‚Äôs the difference between Romo-Bryant connection and Weeden/Cassel/Moore/Prescott-Bryant connection. Dez had a monster season in 2014 (Romo‚Äôs last full season) and has been very inconsistent since then. Dez never belonged in that conversation though. Even at his peak people overrated him.   Dez is just black Jordy Nelson with a crappier attitude. Exact same height, weight, 40 time, and pretty similar production (though Jordy‚Äôs is both a little better and a little more scattered due to injury).  Even then, Dez‚Äôs only All Pro year was 2014, where he had 88 catches, 1350 yards, and 16 TDs. That year Nelson did not receive All Pro honors and had 98 catches, 1500 yards, and 13 TDs.  It has always been this way. Dez is a tier down from the greats, the only reason people seem to rate him as a true game breaker is because he talks a ton. And also the fact that we straight up FEED him the ball in the red zone. He bitches about not getting the ball so we fucking pass it to him to make him happy. The common thought is once you get him going he's unstoppable. So our offense becomes about getting him the ball to get his confidence up, then we can do other things. The issue is he can't hold on to balls anymore and hamstrings our offense to the point where we finally have to do something else. Then it's too late and he starts having sideline tantrumsI have absolutely no memory of McNabb in a Vikings uniform.I prefer the timeline of when Ram's legend Nick Foles won us the b2b Superbowls.Yo Viking fans where you at? How does this salt taste?Saints V Vikings NFC Champ Game?At least you guys won't have to worry about a playoff collapse. Silver linings and all.That was... beautiful. Sums everything up pretty damn well. Good job!This.  This kills the Cowboys fan.If Jerry wants all the credit what's stopping him from being both the owner and the head coach or GM?

Agreed, hadn't seen this one before but it's quite good.Watch Jerry try to trade for Sean Payton That kind of mentality is going to hold you guys back from having success next year imo, there are tons of issues to address with your team and if you think you're losing because the NFL fucked you over you will probably have a down year next year as well even with ZekeThere's nothing Jerry loves more than a coach willing to publicly suck him off and stand back to let Jerry make all sorts of terrible decisions for the team...Garrett is safe for as long as Jerrys alive.I mean look at Jordys games with Rodgers this season vs with Hundley. I mean Prescott is better than Hundley but people underestimate how much QB-WR chemistry matters.Whichever Cowboys game had Romo in the booth most recently really showed how deep their connection was. Dude could not stop talking about the exact throws Dez needed to be successful. He‚Äôs honestly a pretty situational receiver, but Romo knew exactly how to get him involved.I'd keep it that way, he got benched for Ponder...Feels good seeing Packers fans fall back in every single way they claimed they were "better" than other fans.  Also, just to get this out there.  2 teams in the NFC North lost their starting QB and RB this year to injury.  One is 12-3 and on their way to a first round, the other is 7-8 and missed the playoffsHonestly, it's like Packer fans care more about the Vikings than their own team. Kinda sad IMO.Tastes fine. At least our second string QB can throw a fraking ball. That game thread would be atrocious [If you've never seen the whole video before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_MyUGq7pgs)Sounds like the Panthers but our players save our coaches asses most games lol They‚Äôre more UNC fansEwwBarcelona looks like they might take the La Liga title.Go with Man City then. 14 pts clear from 2nd currentlyBarca just beat real 3-0 yesterday, so it‚Äôd be them. Jets?Dez for Sean Payton. Done. Do it. It's good for everyone, or something.That's true.  Before 49ers legend Garoppolo, I didn't know we had a receiver named Goodwin. [deleted]I was gonna bring that up. It says a lot to me that Romo and Sanchez are gone and this is how Dak plays. Guaranteed Romo was telling Dak "dude when he goes out like this you gotta throw him open like that"  And our inept f***ing coaches can't talk to him to coach that up?Christian Ponder the boy wonder?Watching Charles Woodson "Feast on young quarterbacks" in his 3 int game against Ponder was probably the most memorable football moment for me and my brother. Not really sure why it stands out so much but I can still hear the announcer's voice say that. Would very well be 6-9 if one of those teams didn't happen to be the Browns...That would be the Lions subreddit, if they‚Äôre not talking about Caldwell or Ebron it turns into an autistic FTP circlejerk.   If I‚Äôm honest here, the Vikes are my least hated NFCN rival because they made the division competitive again and that makes me happy. I would be god damned if I would ever root for the Bears or Lions but if it‚Äôs the Vikings, I don‚Äôt mind the Lombardi coming back to the NFCN. Same.Demarcus Lawrence balled out.  Sean Lee balled out.  Zeke balled out.  Defense balled out.  Bailey kept us in the game despite his last 2 misses.  OLine lost this game.  How can we go from having the best OLine in the league a season ago to tanking it this season.  Heard there‚Äôs a rift where some of them went full hipster and root for the underdog Kentucky This. UNC has a bigger bandwagon than Duke. keep your hands away from my coachThat's really interesting, and as a fan who never played the game, I never would have considered the fact that elite QBs would know what *kind* of pass to throw to a specific receiver.I've been saying this since early last year. As an Eagles, I have fucking nightmares of Dez ripping the ball out of the air 40-yards down the sideline. NOT NO MORE I DON'T.Incredible comment Yeah, it seems like Dak just doesn‚Äôt know when Dez is ‚Äúopen‚Äù. He‚Äôs not very fast or a truly great route runner, but he‚Äôs one of the best players in the league at turning a 50/50 ball into a big play. Dak either doesn‚Äôt trust him enough to put it up there for him or doesn‚Äôt have the experience to look for those opportunities. It‚Äôs been long enough now that they should probably just admit that Dak and Dez aren‚Äôt going to work and start shopping Dez this off-season.Thats more on dak in opinion. I honestly dont think he is that good no disrespect to you. I also happen to think romo is a hall of fame talent so its hard to expect the same results out of the next guy The boy wander?  Fucking English and rhyming...Well you both played the Browns, so it kind of washes out. My best friend was acting morose that whole game against the Browns. I kept telling him.. Dude, if it's not 59:59 the Browns still have time to lose. üòÇLoss of Romo as a mentor/play caller> How can we go from having the best OLine in the league a season ago to tanking it this season.  We let Leary walk, Free retired, and Tyron Smith decided to be made of glass this seasonWe lost two members and Smith is hurt and the new guys suck. Well yeah, but that‚Äôs because fuck Duke. You think so? I‚Äôve always thought Duke had a bigger bandwagon. Seems like they have more fans with no connection to the schoolNot in Ohio at least. I see waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more Duke "fans". Hundley knows that too. If our receiver is covered by a purple jersey, target the purple jerseyRomo was actually talking about that during the only Cowboys game he covered this year.  How he would try to put the football right on the defender's shoulder so Bryant could go up and get it, and how they worked on it for hours after practice.  All this was overlayed by replays of dak overthrowing Bryant and the defender by five yards.I honestly feel bad for Tony Romo. He carried that team on his back and still gets blamed for them not making/winning in the playoffs. People would always point out his late game picks but forget that he would have 4 TDs with 300+ yards in the air. Throwing a pick at that point might cost you the game but you wouldn't even be in it without those 4 TDs he already forced into tight coverage.Well Romo was always the superior QB, just couldn't stay healthy unfortunately.Adding on to this to add: fuck duke.  Well they do have a much smaller student body
r/nfl, Hightower was my choice.  He was unreal.Tbh, If the Rams were actually able to stop Edelman, Gilmore probably would have gotten itIf his forced fumble was recovered by the Pats he would have gotten it. Basically need like 3 game changing plays to get it on defense. Last SB:  Patriots can't stop anything. Eagles score everytime they have the ball.  Pats can hardly be stopped themselves.  This time:  Pats can stop almost everything.  But they can't score.  Bizarro SBs.Belichick was the MVPCalais is wokeI think Jared Goff would have defensive MVP for the Pats locked in actually Slater actually could have been the MVP at the half, he played out of his mindTrue. But Jules was the offense. Edelman was like 75% of Brady's yards.   It was a similar thing with Deion Branch in Super Bowl 39. Honestly wish they would have given it to the entire defense, but since they only give it to one guy, it's hard to argue with 141 yardsIt was tied between Edelman and Gilmore - it could have been either of them!This game was Bill Belichick's masterpiece. It's not like he needed anything else to solidify his legacy, but goddamn. In a season defined by offensive explosions, he had a gameplan that held one of the best offenses in the NFL to 3 fucking points. 3 points. In a Super Bowl. And they did it because they knew every Rams strength and weak point and knew exactly how to attack them. They were prepared for everything.  This was Belichick's version of the Falcons game for Brady. It's the game where you just can't deny that he is the best fucking coach to ever do it anymore.Edelman was essentially their entire offense until the 4th quarter....Defenses tend to be looked at more as a singular unit rather than individual player skill.Edelman's plays kept the Patriots D off the field. Him pulling off those plays I'm pretty sure put pressure on the Rams. I'm drunk so what the fuck do I know.He had 10 for 150 tho Jared Goff is the Hollywood version of Blake Bortles.Well edelman moved the chains like a man possesed..that helped the d by lettin them rest and play to their full potential every time they stepped on the fieldThe disrespect Thank you Calais Campbell. Its a disgrace that so many retired NFL players helped push the narrative that this was a boring and forgettable Super Bowl. It was a one possession game for the first 58 minutes of regulation. Suspense is what makes title games exciting not fucking volume offense. The refs remembered that this is a contact sport and actually let the players play tonight and Belichick treated us to a master class on defensive game planning this postseason between completely shutting down KC for 3 quarters and then that showing tonight. Edelman converted,  sustained,  created drives. I loved the defense,  but I don't think #11 was a bad pick for MVP.Edelman was absolutely deserving. The entire defense played well, it was a defensive battle, but Edelman was their whole offense. He single handedly kept the patriots ahead in the field position battle. Should have made the entire Pats defense MVP. They played their asses off. Yeah this is why you don‚Äôt start voting during the game Yea Patriots defense was the star of the show tonightYeah they never give it to defenders which is pure bullshit.  You literally gotta play like prime LT on a crack binge to even be considered.SpongeBob was MVP.Should Gilmore have got it?I'm sure Gilmore gives no fucks and is happy with his 1st ring.I‚Äôm torn because I agree with him, but I‚Äôm also PRETTY happy cause Edelman got the mvpIf NFL wants to give MVP exclusively to offense, then defense deserves one too. this is one of those times they should have given the MVP to Belichick. the real GOAT out there.That‚Äôs my defensive end.Or the O lineFANS VOTE FOR THE SUPERBOWL MVP! Jason McCourty saved a sure TD.Voters really, really hate to give award to defensive player, especially if they don't score.   And not the first time award should've gone either to defensive player, or defense as a whole (2007 Giants, for example)I seriously cannot fathom how shitty the Rams played tonight. Remember Edelman watched the 2018 Super Bowl from the stands in Minneapolis. NE probably wins that game with him. And no PED suspensionI fee like Van Noy should have been it.  Had 2 sacks and was a monster in coverage and pressure.  If the Rams won I wanted Hekker as MVPThe entire D could have won MVP. But we are nowhere this post-season or this game w o E. The rams offense also sucked all game. I thought the same thing, but you know... Offensive league. Also, if ever a special teams player would make SB MVP, it would've been this year; Slater and Allen were seriously on fire today. The defense was great and Edelman was great too. Should have a defensive MVP and an offensive MVP like they do for the regular season.The NFL snubs Defensive players because they want to focus on their offenses. It‚Äôs sad really: most defenders, Gilmore included, don‚Äôt get the credit they deserve in big games. How many times has a defensive player won the Super Bowl MVP, or even Regular MVP?   The NFL clearly wants games like the Rams Chiefs game we had earlier this year. They‚Äôve taken away so many ways for the defense to actually hit people it‚Äôs not fun to watch a defense actually perform anymore: usually because the offense is too inept to do anything instead of the defense actually doing good.  On the positive side, at least we made it through one game without hearing the announcers say "remember all scoring plays are reviewable," so we've got that going for us, which is nice.Offense is overrated. Defense is a much harder thing to pull off IMO and deserves a lot more respect.I'd have given it to the punterI wonder what kind of bonus Edleman's roid dealer gets.Defense gets no love these days in the NFL. They make some of the biggest plays but these days their accomplishments are treated like second rate compared to offensive feats since they are easier keep track of the stats.newer nfl fans and i think the younger nfl fans do not appreciate defense the way people used to. its all about who can throw up the most points because thats whats more entertaining to people. thats why people call QBs garbage when they dont have HOF stat lines every year.  im a louisville fan and when we had charlie strong people would shit on him so much for how passive he was on offense because he was all about defense. we would win so many games by small margins and people hated that. but at the end of the day if it wins games who cares? (the casual fan is the answer to that)Unpopular opinion but I actually wanted Gronk for stepping up big on the game winning drive. say it with me: a punter should have won Superbowl MVP. I'm just surprised they didn't give it Offensive Genius Sean McVay. He da real MVP!Let's be real guys, Jared Goff deserves the MVP for his performance tonight. He single handedly won this game for the Patriots.I mean the defense just put on a masterful game but this enlightened section just goes: "Game sucked, lets talk about who Brady kissed"I have mixed feelings about Edelman as the MVP. I kindof like it but kindof don't.  On the one hand, this game was won by the defense - and by an all time great, outstanding, incredible defensive performance. Linebacker Derek Brooks won the MVP in Super Bowl 37 and they gave up 21 points that game to the league's #2 offense. This Patriots' team gave up *only 3* to the league's #2 offense and the Patriots' defense was *far* more important to this game than the Buccaneers' was SB 37. If Brooks could win it, then a defensive player really ought to win it here.  On the other hand, even though the Patriots' offense was unable to put many points on the board in this game, Edelman's incredible performance of keeping the chains moving and maintaining possession played a very large part in keeping the Rams' offense off the field and letting the Patriots' defense stay rested so that they could keep up the pressure and put up the game that they did. In this way, Edelman actually played a major role in keeping that Rams' team at 3 points. I would even say this: part of the problem with giving it to a defender is picking which one to give it to. Defense is by necessity so much more consistently a team performance while in offense you can have a standout more easily.  However, I think in light of the way he played the entire game PLUS the interception, Gilmore could have been the guy. Up until that point I was saying, "maybe Edelman or Gronkowski," but at that INT I said, "there you go. Gilmore could be the guy."  Still, I think on balance in a 3 point performance like this a defender really ought to win it. My bottom line is that I would have given it to a defender, but am not terribly upset that Edelman won it and don't think that Edelman is a bad choice.Still though, Edelman kept the offense on the field with a ton of crucial first downs. A lot of those didn't result in points, but without dominating the time of possession battle, I don't think our defense could have sustained its dominant performance. It was such a complementary game it's hard to identify any one MVP. Everyone made plays when it really mattered. Jason McCourty on the pass breakup in the endzone, Gilmore with the int, Brady and Gronk on the TD drive, Michel on the key first downs to seal it...If you could give it to the defense or the secondary as a whole then definitely. But no one gave a more impressive singular performance than Edelman.I wish they could give the SB MVP to a whole unit, b/c they were lights out for every second of the game.Calais be woke babyif they also recover that fumble I think Gilmore could have won itThe defense was clearly the MVP but you can't give 11 guys the MVP lol. Gilmore, Hightower, Van Noy, take your pick, all 3 were deservingThe defense played incredibly well, but Edelman is 100% deserving of the MVPIn 2007, I would have given the MVP to "The Giants Pass Rush."  Here, I'd give it to "Both team's Pass Rush."He's right.  Gilmore was outstanding.AgreedIts bc the announcers kept selling edelman for it the whole gameSeriously Gillmore totally should have gotten it, but I love Jules. Guy was ballin‚ÄôUnfortunately only way you‚Äôre getting it as a defender is with a TD, maybe multiple INTsThe fact anyone on offense got any award tonight is a fucking jokeIt's because edleman was the entire offense. All of the pats defense played well.Michel should have got it in my opinion. He ran well.It was a team win if I've ever seen one. Edelman, Michel, Gronk, the entire defense, and Ryan Allen all had great contributions.Jason McCourty had the play of the game in my opinion. Knocking the ball out of Cooks' hands in the endzone when it was still 3-3 was the play of the game for meI think edelman deserved it. More important than his actual stats he had like 8 1st Downs. unreal. This game was all about field position and Edelman was the key to field position I think he deserved itonly 11 defensive players have ever won the superbowl mvp. we notice the scores. not prevented scores.Can I just say that there was a 0 percent chance it was going to happen... but Patriots Punter Ryan Allen was a beast tonight. He pinned the Rams deep over and over. It was tough for them to drive the length of the field. He made the defense's job easier.  He made the strongest case for any punter to be SB MVP, ever. (without some trick play or weird play where he ran back a fumble for a TD or something)I mean I get it but without 11 moving the chains and moving the ball down field it'd still be 3 - 3 and we'd still be in overtime! I kinda agree. I was legit shocked when Edelman got Super bowl MVP I really felt someone on defense was going to get it.  If it was someone on offense I thought it would be like Sony Michel cause he had 18 touches for 94 yards and more importantly a TD. But 10 catches for 141 yards is lit too.   I agree with Calais that it should be someone on defense tho. To contain that offense to just 3 points in a low scoring game and have the MVP be on offense is just wrong This years Super Bowl was a defensive masterclass. If the Pats receiving core was 3 or 4 Edelmans they'd have put up 40.  Brady struggled, Hogan was down right terrible, Dorset was invisible Paterson's only real contribution was a jet sweep.  Offense over all didn't impress.  If you could give the defense the MVP as a unit I'd be all for it but I have no qualms at all about Edelman as MVP,  dude was the only one on offense who really showed up and made plays all night.  No way was it Jules fault they only scored 13.I wanted Gilmore to get it too since he was one of our best players on defense, but man the whole defense played well. Awesome pressure, great coverage, etc.I don't disagree that the defensive players get shafted a lot and deserve more consideration, but how much better can you do as a WR than 10 catches on 12 targets for 141 yards? There were some great defensive performances in this game, but no one should act like they were robbed when Edelman had a near perfect performance. Where‚Äôs Johnny Hekker???Edelman earned his MVP. it could have gone to gilmore. I thought van noy had a great game as well. total team defence was amazing.The new ‚ÄúEdelman is a HOFer‚Äù narrative that seems to have come from nowhere needed another chapter. You basically have to have an all time performance to get it as a defender, unfortunately.   Clarification: Edelman deserved it just as much. He was probably consistently the best player on the field.The Rams were terrible. Curse of Suh. You know....this is a really good point.I'd have gone with the punter tbf.This is like Super Bowl 50 where both defenses played spectacularly but neither offense could get into gear. There was a defensive MVP that year. Why not again this year?I blame Romo for highlighting how uncoverable Edelman was ever 5 minutes. Can't they just give it to him next year?I‚Äôm late to the party, but Edelman deserves this. Routinely breaking open even once they started playing double coverage.  It is not just the number of yards, but the comparative efficiency.  Edelman went 10/12. All other Patriots receivers went 11/23. So 83% vs. 47%  Plus, there is note that he was not incredibly dominant on their scoring drives. While that is true, the defense also had to shift plans. When Edelman draws 2 every snap, it starts to open other options.Yeah but Botha defenses were great. Edelman was the only player on either offense to do anything‚ÄúYou gotta have a good, young offensive mind as your HC in today‚Äôs NFL‚Äù üòÇüòÇhe rightEdelman said in his post-game interview that the MVP should have been the entire defense...  MVP doesn't mean jack for a team game like football, unless a player really takes the team and puts them on his back.  Even then, it takes a  team...Without Edelman, that offense doesn‚Äôt move the ball last night. Gilmore would‚Äôve been deserving too but let‚Äôs not act like Edelman wasn‚Äôt.Probably because of the pass interference non-call on Cooks. Which by the way, NE always gets that interference call. counter argument: edelman was lights out in a true defensive battle. that is noteworthy too. Think if he‚Äôd held onto that pick he‚Äôd have had more of a shout Hightower was so damn good tonight.That dropped pick and fumble he almost got before going out of bounds would have settled it.  I also bet on him at +20000 and it made me sad.Dude has had one hell of a football career. I still remember him dominating on the field at Alabama where he won 2 BCS titles. He then goes on to spend his entire pro career as the centerpiece of the Patriots defense, winning 3 championships thus far. Hightower was outstanding. But almost defensive player made some kind of big play.  Danny Shelton (you'd be forgiven for forgetting that he's still on the team) had a monster run stuff to stop any momentum. I think Hightower got there too.  J. McCourty had that unforgettable PBU in the end zone.  Van Noy with the megasack, plus the hard hit on Goff along the sidelines.  Flowers got Gurley with a head of steam and just planted him in the fourth quarter.  Harmon replaced Chung seamlessly and had a few very nice moments in coverage.  Gilmore, the pick.  Jones was absolutely everywhere all night.   As a unit, they were just spectacular.  It could have gone to any of the 3 of them and I'd be ok with it. They all made their cases.Goff will see him in his nightmaresHightower and huge super bowl plays name a more iconic duoUntil he dropped a pass thrown right to him. He looked like classic Hightower. XLIX flashbacks This whole thread is the reason that Hightower is always my linebacker of choice every new Madden year (until I can start getting 99s ofc)If he had been healthy last year that SB ends differently.True. VanNoy was a big factor too People actually said this man was completely washed at the beginning of the season. High was a grown man out thereIt's usually given to big stats guys. If he had a eye-popping amount of tackles or a few turnovers he would've gotten it. Edelman deserved it though, and I thought Michel had a chance coming up big in the second half and scoring the only touchdown.I would have made $8000 off of a $50 dollar bet if this had happened. If he caught that interception, he would have had it in my opinion I agree. For a player that reportedly couldn't pass a physical for the Jets a few years ago, has a history of knee problems, and has looked slow at times the last few seasons he completely balled out. He and KVN had some great pressure on Goff and allowed the Pats to stay with minimal d-linemen but get maximum pressure.Ryan Allen thoughI'm still shocked Allen didn't get it. He was unbelieveable punting the ball.Hightower should have gotten it. The combination of his past Super Bowl performances should have put him over the edge. That's if they even won without Edelman going ballisticOr if they could've given the MVP to the entire defenseThe Rams defense didn't do a bad job. They held the Patriots to 3 for most of the game and 13 for the whole game. The Rams offense was just trash.Gilmore should‚Äôve won regardless.  Only gave up 3 points, a pick, forced fumble and 3 pbusTbh if the rams offense led by ‚Äúoffensive wizard‚Äù mcvey were able to score more than 3 points we might have had an interesting football game.   Sincerely, A bears fan not salty about anything at allIt's still bullshit. Offensive players always get the extra over ratings They probably would‚Äônt of driven down the field without EdelmanThey said Edelman was a hall of fame last night too I was laughing so hard. 30 career touchdowns.Which sort of sucks. I think giving up 3 points as a defense should count as 1 game changing play for everyone on that side of the ball. Then 2 big game changing plays should be enough to go along with playing well as a team.That play was awesome.  Anderson stiff armed Gilmore to the shadow realm and Gilmore ripped the ball out, sending it backwards.Ignoring "held a team averaging 32 per game to 3 points", Gilmore caused a fumble that stopped CJ from a first down on one of their few decent drives. Then broke up a potential TD catch in the 4th, and snagged the (essentially) game-sealing pick right after. Those are all arguably more impactful than most of Edelman's catches (seven in the first half where the team totalled three points).SB52: Two amazing offenses, with the Eagles defense getting one key stop to win  SB53: Two amazing defenses, with the Pats offense getting one key drive to win  Perfectly balanced, as all things should beBill Belichick is the best coach in American sports history  the guy is a fucking genius  he builds defenses out of scrap parts and they just get shit doneThis is his goddamn masterpiece. He had the D ready for every single fucking thing the Rams wanted to do.First person I've seen to give him credit. It's unbelievable that he's *underrated* lol.You are not wrongyepDefinitely, take Belicheck away from this team and they lose 8-10 games every year, probably more.He knows Ds are disrespectedPorzingis got to him He's not wrong. They oughta give him a Super Bowl Champs hat for his troubleI dont know. The Rams‚Äô OL also deserved the defensive MVPGosling should stick to movies Speaking of special teams, Allen and Hekker were nailing punts all game.Yeah if Jules doesn‚Äôt play, the defense would be on the field a lot more and not look as goodSony Michel did pretty wellTrue. But the offense didn‚Äôt win them the game He had 141 of 262 so more around 50%, I get he contributed to a lot of first downs but they held a historically great offense to 3 points  Edit:  theyd be ranked 9th (527) on all time points scored and scored 89 more points than the 4th highest scoring team this year (436 to the patriots)   https://www.google.com/amp/s/thefalconswire.usatoday.com/2017/01/02/falcons-finish-2016-season-no-7-all-time-in-points-scored/amp/  http://www.espn.com/nfl/standingsExactamundo. They put up video game numbers on defense. Unreal. A master class of scheme and performance.To me it's the 8 first downs on ten catches.This. Edelman was the bright spot in an overall poor offense. Defense was amazing as a unit.give it to Allen those sweet punts were hugeHightower is in there, too.Van Noy was great tooWade had a helluva game too but bill just too goodBB said himself that Brian Flores designed the entire defensive game plan. He deserves much more credit. Miami is getting them a solid coach.I agree.  I almost wanted them to give it to belichick.But they scored 10 of their 13 points in the 4th...I'm pretty sure Brady is going to be buying that guy a boat or something.  ...probably a matching house too.Because it takes all 11 guys to stop a play, especially a pass play.  But, for example, a running back can break 3 tackles and run for 20 yards despite shit blocking.  The person with the ball just matters more for the game's outcome.Malcom Smith, Ray Lewis, and Dexter Jackson all won Super Bowl MVP after great team defensive performances. Their teams even managed to score more than 20 points. If you can single out a great offensive player when the offense has success, why can't you do it on defense? Not on Gilmore Blake Bortles put up better production against New England last year than Goff did tonight. Don't you dare speak ill of Blake...   Raise your bortlesHe was the Hollywood version of Ben Roethlisberger in SB 40Don't disrespect the BOAT like that. He can actually play the Pats.Bortles can read defenses. God I wish we had the Rams' offensive line. I think Ben Rothlisburger is the Hollywood version of Cam Newton, in that he has raped people. It‚Äôs obviously a team effort but when the offence puts up 13pts, it‚Äôs pretty clear the defence was the reason they won this game. My friend disray got new specsDisrespekt, even. Not a bad pick, but just shows how offense is all the matters. Even in a game with no offense.Absolutely lights out. Don‚Äôt know WHERE the fuck that came from this postseason but I will happily take itHE WAS NUMBER ONE!I was predicting Gilmore but Edelman wasn't undeserving or anything.Yes.:'(Fucking thank you. I have annoyed my friends for years insisting that Michael Strahan & Justin Tuck deserved MVP over fucking Eli in 2007.They didn't do that bad.. Their defense held patriots to 13 point... He's a former Lion which automatically disqualifies him.Where‚Äôs Ryan Allen?Yeah or the fumble recovery would have sealed itIf he holds onto that pick, Chung doesn't get his arm snapped like a twig :(Dude always steps it up a couple levels in the Super Bowl. He was the defensive catalyst against the Falcons, and again in Rams-Pats II"If he could catch, he'd be a wide receiver."> Jones was absolutely everywhere all night  Like we all know he's fast, it's always brought up but holy shit was it on display last night. It felt like that dude was zipping sideline to sideline before and during play after play and just kept his speed.Goff missed a wide open Cooks. And then Cooks drops the TD to tie the game. They had their shots. The Buffalo Bills and losing Super Bowls.Kelvin Benjamin and 413 PSI blood vessels Dude had more tape on his hands that on an entire hockey stick He was pretty extended on that play. It‚Äôs a tough grab for a LB.He had three touches on their three scoring drives. So guessing they would‚Äôve. Or the whole OlineWould have been fitting in the city of the Hawks starting 5Rams offense played so fucking scared and timid until that INT driveSorry, what is a PBU?I think he has more of a case if they actually recover the fumble since he‚Äôd have generated 2 turnovers thenCould they have won without Gilmore's performance? I think so. Without Edlemans? They wouldn't have scored at all.Wouldn't of should be wouldn't have, my dude. They should just have an OMVP and DMVP. We all know They Would rather give it to an Offensive player because it draws more fans. But defensive players deserve recognition too. Just split the award.Just for the sake of conversation, what about big first downs? Keeping a drive alive is as big as shutting an opposing drive down.Yeah but it's much easier to credit 140 yards to the receiver than it is to credit 3 points allowed to an individual defender. They may have scored 3, but thanks to his yards they won the field position battle and had the Rams offense on the back foot all half so it's hard to say it wasn't impactfulCompletely agree, and I love Edelman.If you told me last year that the Eagles would give up 33 points, I would've *known* we would lose.  If you told me before last night that the Rams would only give up 13, I would've said they crushed the Pats.  Football is weird sometimes.SB51: Not balanced at all IN A CAVE  WITH A BOX OF SCRAPSI love how the NBA and the NFL have arguably the GOAT coaches currently coaching and they both act the same towards the media.  It's great.American sports yes.  But I would argue that Scotty Bowman (NHL coach) is the best in *North* American sports history. Hard to argue with 9 titles as a coach and 5 more as an exec (mostly scouting and development)  Plus he was involved heavily with dynasties or eras of dominance with 4 different teams over his career (70's Canadiens, early 90's Penguins, late 90's/early 2000's Red Wings, 2010's Blackhawks)  Everything the man has touched has turned to solid gold, and as much as I respect Belichick I still think Bowman is a bit better.Belichick isn't a bad answer to the "GOAT coach" question, but for me it's still Scotty Bowman.> Bill Belichick is the best coach in American sports history  I'd go a half-step further and claim that he's #2 in *worldwide* sports history behind Alex Ferguson.His father literally wrote the book on football scouting'What're you gonna do now,Bill?'Kyle van noy for a 7th!!!Paul Brown went to the league championship 10 years in a row.To be fair, he had some amount of help by Gurley not being 100%, which plays into Belichick‚Äôs greatest strength ‚Äì getting the opposing team into predictable situations and then taking advantage of that opportunity. Definitely made it up to McDaniels for last year lolBB doesn't get enough credit imo. Brady is the face of the dynasty but BB is the one keeping it together for so long. We've seen elite QBs struggle because they don't have a good enough team around them, but BB has made sure that Brady has the weapons he's needed to be so good for so long, and even has given Brady some nasty defenses to go along with their insane offense. That defense last night was dirty. BB did the rams absolutely dirty.I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs underrated. I think he‚Äôs so good it‚Äôs not even worth a discussion. I‚Äôve never heard anyone making a case against Belichick being the best coach ever in the sport. Unfortunately I think they decided it was 1/2 great defense and 1/2 Goff not being able to process a defense without someone running free on his first read (or 2nd read even). Obviously Gilmore was a monster and could have won it, but that's my take at leastJanus is an anusHe'll have to go to Africa for hisAnd a ringYeah I think people ignoring how Rams o line was mediocre and their WR‚Äôs were barely openI thought he had Drive. He did not have Drive. Has Allen been that good all season? I was surprised I hadn't heard about him because he was fucking nailing those punts all game. Even with our garbage offense, if just a couple of those punts weren't absolute beauties, we might have been able to open things up a bit more. Pat McAfee jizzing his pantsWas my choice for mvp. 5 ypc was a great number, he was solid the whole playoff runJules got like 10 first downs. Without him the Rams wouldn‚Äôt have been playing deep in their own end every drive.  Wait... what?"historically great"  What? Relative to their era this offense was just really good, not historically greatWill you stop posting this everywhere. They were 11th. And that came in a year where scoring was at an all time high. They are not a historically great offense by any means.I think that is what is being lost in the whole "this is boring" stuff. Sure, I wasn't excitied but damn was that not a solid defensive gameIdk about you but I‚Äôve never held the patriots to 13 on MaddenOr slater for some lights out field position stopsDoes he get an assist on the FG and the XP? Because the punts plus two points is pretty good.Then he should have gotten that pick six. Lol.   Stud tonight tho.Hightower is my boy, I was wearing his jersey but he was a second to Edelmam/Gilmore's dominating performance.Yes. Lost in all this is the valiant effort by the Rams D that, despite being on the field after every 3 plays by the Rams offense, held on for a long time before finally cracking in the 4th. Hell they looked gassed halfway through the 3rd quarter.Honestly I thought the Rams defense was better schemed than the Pats. It‚Äôs too bad the offense shit the bed.Those yards still matter. The best defense is the other team starting at their own 2.Exactly. Dont try and trick my ass into thinking anyone on either side of the offense deserves it. I can't get those 4 hours back. ... Because Edelman's stellar play kept the Rams D on the field. Cause and effect. Gilmore, Hightower and co. were amazing but Edelman deserves MVP imo, his play set the tone for the team, LA players just couldn't get near him.The fact that this dude is serious with this and people upvote it makes you realize the kinds of people you‚Äôre dealing with on this sub. If Julian Edelman doesn‚Äôt play, the Rams win this game. Tom Brady was pathetic. He couldnt even make routine passes out there. The run game was there but nothing magical. Julian was literally the entire offense for large parts of this game. Take him out and everything changes. Game flow. Position. Defensive rest / TOP. A million other things.   Do you seriously think his work in the first 75% of the game are all meaningless because HURR DURR NO POINTS IT ALL CAME IN THE 4TH?Houseboats are pretty fucking cool lmaoFair enough Damn. Got'emHe did better this year tooTrue. Goff is just Mike Glennon with a surfboard.And a lot of teams put up better production against the Rams than Brady did tonight. I don't think that's a great way of comparing.And captain Kirk put up 31 on the Rams earlier this year, guess he must be better than Brady? Yea but jarod Goff is 24 on the biggest stage there is against a Bill bellicheck lead team that had two full weeks to game plan on him. Relax with the comparisons and acting like his career is already written and it‚Äôs doomed Hey don't disrespect Big Ben. He threw 2 picks and Goff only threw 1.  2 > 1 Except Ben won.You don't want that o-line that showed up tonight.And their receivers.I honestly think the Rams should've ran some shallow crossers to help Goff cause it worked so well for Bortles against the PatsThey only needed 4.  If the Pats scored 40, would you say the offense won the game?My friend Pat took a turnThank you for your service.Oh was that him who got close? Yeah then definitely. Wow he came so close to 2 huge plays https://i.imgur.com/QmdzaO8.jpgI'm not gonna lie. If there was any time for a punter to win MVP. It was tonight!  He had 5 punts within the 5 yard line. He killed it tonightI feel bad for Chung manDon't forget the tackle on Lynch to set up the Butler pick! Imagine if he was healthy last year he's a huge part of their defense. Imagine spending your career on the Pats and all you come away with is 3+ rings.  Hightower is the new BruschiI too have played a singular game of madden whilst my corner drops a pass literally thrown at him.I kinda forgot about that play. Damn it really was right in his arms.Yeah he was so fucking wide open. Nobody within almost 10 yards of him.Haven't the Broncos lost more Super Bowls than the Bills?That's ignoring the importance of field position on all of the drives they didnt score on. Get first downs is important even if you dont put points up. He also extended other drives even if they didn't score. Keeping the Rams D on the field and tired and their own freshThis game was won on clock control. Edelman was a key part of that. It was one of the more complete team performances I've seen in a long time. Everyone played pretty well on the Pats. Nobody really stood out as carrying the team. Hogan looked real bad, but besides that everyone looked sharp.  Just give it to Goff for choking and call it good.I would've LOVED that.  Give the MVP to the entire O-line just so everyone in the media can say "Why, what do they do exactly?"With Gurley not being Gurley for whatever reason it obviously hobbled their offence and Bill was throwing so many defensive looks at Goff he was rattled, pressured and off target all game.  Pass break ups Peanut Butter UnderwearHow‚Äôd you like to be DMVP in a 52-45 game lolThis exactly. Johnny Hekker kept sending the Patriots far, far back. Without Edelman pick up first downs and moving the ball, this game would be taken place in Pats territory with the Rams at least snipping a few field goals.But we're not... Bill Belicheck... With a fookin pencil...  A fookin pencilLmao. I think NCAA football too, Sabin is just untouchable at timesPop is a lot more respectful tbh. Phil Jackson isn't coaching at the moment, and John Wooden died a few years ago.Ah yes. The truly terrifying Red Wings of old. 25 years of playoff appearances. Talk about defying odds.Same, and for me it's a toss up some days it's so close. For sure though, Phil Jackson is #3 for me.:/Brady is definitely a important price of the puzzle  but BB is far more important. It‚Äôs incredible how consistently he can field top defenses and special teams. In all his time as a patriots coach the worst defense he has fielded ranked 17th. Literally worst case scenario the defense is average. IMO, Gilmore played as good of a game as Malcolm Smith did in 48. It seemed like maybe one or maybe two passes got past him, and they did so for very little gain. All those children so excited that LA finally got a super bowl win!üé∂I bless the Rams down in Africaüé∂It's easier to ignore circumstances and just laugh at the QB, so that's what the narrative will be. Unfortunately.  The Rams' pass protection was as effective as a set of turnstiles. Goff had no time to throw and was constantly being knocked down, and the impacts added up. By the fourth quarter, you could see bruises all over his throwing hand and what was visible of his arm.   It's no wonder he was missing throws downfield. Not many QBs would be able to pass well after falling on their throwing arm a dozen times in an hour.Mediocre is underselling it. It was impressive that Goff only got sacked 4 times considering the pressure he was under. It clearly took a toll on him and almost nothing else he did was impressive, but credit him for that at least. I pretty much cant remember him having a clean pocket for more than a second or two on any play. From what I saw that Pats D line was having their way all night. Kinda cringed on that one sack Goff got hit by 3 lineman consecutively.I think, though I'm biased, that Allen has been slept on. He's always been above average every year in his whole career, if not one of the top punters in the league. Although, I don't know how much you can really sleep on a punter, since the only well known ones are ones with gimmicks like Hekker with the crazy fakes and McAfee with the personality.Not to mention BB himself. He *loves* his special teams, especially punters.Michel ran well, but their run blocking was fantastic for most of the game. That's more of a team effort than Jules getting open at will all gameThat's what I think.  Edelman kept the rams off the field for at least 10 minutes of actual game clock time. When you score 13 points and still win the match, you can bet the offense wasn't the real highlight on your team.  Edit: 13 not 10 lolThere were like 4 offenses just as good this year alone...They‚Äôre in the top 10* points scored of all time with 527  https://www.google.com/amp/s/thefalconswire.usatoday.com/2017/01/02/falcons-finish-2016-season-no-7-all-time-in-points-scored/amp/Yeah... This wasn't the 2014 Broncos... The Rams had a good offense but I'd argue the matchup against the chiefs was a way better offensive opponentThat's what I really enjoyed about this game.  It was pretty cool to see if the Pats could stop the Rams offense all game and they pretty much did that.  There were a few points it looked like the Rams were about to turn the corner and figure it out, but then the Pats just shut it down.  Yeah that's the problem. The defense played unreal, but from a watching perspective it comes across as a boring game. Looking at it objectively now, the defense was completely lights out. But watching it live, I'm just thinking "Oh look, another incomplete pass" the whole time.And should have recovered that fumble :/  But I honestly think that, though the defense balled out last night, if Edelman hadn't played his soul out, we would have been screwed, because the offense was lackluster. I guess that's what "valuable player" means, the guy who would have made a whole world of difference if removed from the game. Keeping the Rams off the field was important. Even though they didn't hardly score, the Pats had the ball for almost 12 minutes in the first quarter. The Pats defense was obviously phenomenal, but keeping drives going is important, as well. Even if you don't end up scoring, the field position and time of possession matter, which Edelman helped with greatly. Jules torched them early and forced them to start doubling, that helps everyone else on offense.I for one appreciate a good defense superbowl. Especially with all the credit the rams offense got all year. It was boring, sure, but you watched a masterclass of a defensive gameplan from both sidesEh if they didn't get all the first downs he provided, it swings the TOP and maybe even the game thank fucking jesus, preach. all these idiots just think MVP GO TO MAN WHO DO TOUCHDOWN and drool. impact in a game isn't just points, the effects rippleWhen you put him up against a mediocre corner like Peters, that's the result you're gonna get!Media can control how people think. Shit sucks man dudes an alright player and a great guy. First person i'd truly root for no matter what team he goes to Notice how Romo never predicts the Rams' plays? Goff doesn't have enough experience to see the defense yet....Although, we have yet to see if he will at all.And a shiny Sean mcvay.Nick Foles was a back up QB and he whipped out his dick and made belilcheck his bitch in the same situation.  Don‚Äôt make excuses for Goff. Would've still been better than ours. Losing a left tackle is hard but our RT was backup-level all season.Feels like all our receivers are projects that promise to get better soon but we don't know when. I don't think the Pats expected us to throw so much, though. Who knows. I couldn't really tell you much until I watch the film because I skipped large portions of the 2nd half.Much different. In a 40-3 game, the opposing offense is effectively out of the game pretty early on. Rams were still in the game until 4 minutes left. If they could've put together any solid drive, they had a huge chance to win this game. In fact, they were well on their way to tying the game in the 4th. This was 100% a defensive win. Edelman had great stats but it could've been all for nothing had the Rams scored a TD on that 4th quarter drive.Exactly.  But had neither.  Again Gilmore and Hightower and the McCourtys all had great games, but none were particularly standout as an MVP level game.  Edelman had over 50% of Pats receiving yards.Dear lord what was he thinking with that mustache?you boomed meI can't explain it, but I'm disappointed there are so many pixels. This is way better than the Manning picTurning old into goldThanks, I hate it.Hightower has been so fucking clutch in every Superbowl we've won to say nothing of what he does during the whole season.  He played his whole college career for Nick Saban who handed him off to Belichick for pro ball.  Unreal career. Yeah people forget Lynch was scoring on 1st down if he didn't shed off Okung's block 100%He had only one healthy arm to take Lynch down with too. UnrealNot to take anything away from my boy D'onta but it seems Akeem Ayers doesn't get enough cred for that stop either. Our boy Chung also had a hand in that tackle iirc JMac made an AMAZING play. No denying that. I think of the three people directly involved in that play, I assign the outcome to Cooks the least. That throw by Goff was a complete duck, should have gotten to Cookie sooner. And eating up time of possessionSeven of his ten catches were in the first half, where they scored a grand total of three points (and the Rams longest drive was five plays; field position didn't keep the Rams from scoring).  And the two scoring drives in the fourth were 69 and 72 yards, neither benefitting from shifting field position. And he had one touch one those drives.  At the end of the day, he had the best stats in an otherwise shit-show of a game. But I'd argue his stats, nice as they were, were less meaningful than Gilmore and some of the defensive play of the Patriots.I watch very little NFL and a ton of big 12 cfb. This comment made me realize I haven‚Äôt thought about field position or TOP in years..Their D being worn down was also why we were able to successfully run the clock down after the INTIt‚Äôs not about that as much as field position.  Just keeping the ball towards the rams side of the field meant the patriots had fg opportunities and the rams did not.  Remember the patriots missed a field goal too.  If not for that unlikely miss they could have been winning this game on fgs alone.  Without Edelman‚Äôs yards that doesn‚Äôt happen.  The rams probably score another fg and the patriots maybe don‚Äôt and now it‚Äôs close.And the Patriot's defense was an even bigger part of it than Edelman was.Keep the Rams D on the field, so when Goff sees the ball he feels pressure to do something, even though he only trails by 3.  > Hogan looked real bad  Six targets, zero completions, one interception. He had a better game at CB than Gilmore. Those pressures had Goff‚Äôs timing off for sure. I know McVay is blaming himself, but that‚Äôs just one of the downsides to having a young quarterback. If he was able to step up into pressure and deliver a few of those bombs on target it would‚Äôve been a completely different game for the Rams.When did that change from passes defensed (pd)? Or is that different somehow?It'd be a lot like Edelman winning MVP in a 13-3 gameSo basically Aaron Donald in the Chiefs-Rams gameIs that all that different from being OMVP in a 13 3 gameMust be similar to being OMVP in a 13-3 gameDepends. How many of those points were pick 6s?Last year Brandon Graham couldve gotten the DMVP for the strip sack even though the game was all offenseWho does that?It fucking kills me that we had Belichick and Saban AT THE SAME TIME and we still haven‚Äôt won a Super Bowl. not to mention nick sabanBelichick is super cool if you ask football questions though. He is a dick when you ask TMZ shitNeither as good as PopAgreed. Brady is elite, no doubt, and he would be successful no matter where he goes; not 6 rings successful, but successful for sure elsewhere. BB, I feel, could have the same success with a number of QBs at the helm, as long as they work for his system. The good thing Brady and bb have going is that their chemistry is great and has been the entire dynasty and they know they both have their jobs to do.Not only that, but when forced to use backups in NE, Belichick is 15-6 (11-5 in 2008, 3-1 in 2014, and he won at least one playoff game with Bledsoe early on. He is literally over .700 in wins WITHOUT Brady.>Malcom Smith  I know you Seahawk fans are trying to forget 2014, but c‚Äômon now  /sSmith seemed to be more right place right time in that SB, Chancellor or Bennett might‚Äôve deserved it moreNo, everyone in Africa hopped on the Bills bandwagon in the 90s.  4 and 0 baby!I‚Äôd be willing to guess more people in Africa were aware that L.A. was playing in the Super Bowl than people who actually live in L.A. were.He had to basically always go to his first read, and the Pats had that covered on most of the plays. Lotta contested tosses to Woods early on that killed drives.Goff had seemingly no pocket presence though, he was walking into people left and right. If you put Brady or Mahomes or Brees behind that line I don't think the blocking would have looked quite so bad.What about the 10 times he was rolling out to the sideline and refused to throw the ball away? Not even counting them playing catch up. Dude had a horrible gameI think you nailed it. He's incredibly good at his job but as a punter that doesn't get you far in terms of name recognition. Him and Slater were absolutely dealing tonight. As boring as a lot of people found the game, it was cool to see those guys ball out on the big stage considering how underrated they are. That‚Äôs why we scored 13 >10 points?  &#x200B;Yet this rams teams is ranked in the top 10* offenses of all time with 527 points scored  https://www.google.com/amp/s/thefalconswire.usatoday.com/2017/01/02/falcons-finish-2016-season-no-7-all-time-in-points-scored/amp/  This is from 2017 but they‚Äôd be ranked 9th2013 Broncos Yep, and if Edelman couldn‚Äôt keep the offense on the field in the first three quarters, that‚Äôs a lot more quick outs for the Pats, and the defense probably doesn‚Äôt play as well. Plus he did a really good job working Hekkers punts, which were basically the scariest part of the Rams offense. I do, too. This game almost felt more like offense just failing to show up at all or make adjustments. Same here. Everyone has spent the last few years crying about how teams aren't allowed to play defense, then we get a great defensive game on the biggest stage and people can't wait to complain.And the current rules be such that holding *any* team to 3 points is ridiculously hard, but a top offense that much more difficult.Nobody will be able to convince me this season for yall was more Bortles than it was your slew of injuries to key players. Didnt yall lose like your entire O line?Jason McCourty changed that game immensely breaking his assignment and going to hit cooks. Saved a TD in an incredibly close gameDon't forget van noy. He's been lights out all playoffs and was all over Goff tonightYou have to give it to the offense because it was a team effort on doing. Which is BS but what're we gonna do?Did Edelman become the second best receiver in post season games last night behind Jerry Rice?[Manning wore it better anyway.](https://i.imgur.com/OckL8VE.jpg)He was writing home from the frontLuck doesn‚Äôt have a barber. That‚Äôs why his beard is wack and his haircut is also bad. If he had a barber, he wouldn‚Äôt look like a civil war officer. Looks like it's part of a beard that's hidingSupposedly Belichick asked Saban if he should pick Upshaw or Hightower, and it‚Äôs clear why Saban said draft Hightower. Watched the replay of that 100x after that Ayers [PlayersTribune](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/akeem-ayers-rams-super-bowl-patriots) article giving himself credit and not even mentioning Hightower...even w/o Ayers coming in to just touch Lynch after he fell i'm pretty sure Lynch before been ruled down either by Hightower or someone else just touching him before he was able to get back up and run it in. It's 80%+ Hightower for the lunge *precisely* where Lynch juked. Ayers made a co-'tackle' like a DE credited w/ a sack after a QB was pressured right towards him... Hightower also did that while needing shoulder surgery and only coming back for playoffs.And forcing the Rams to double Edelman late which opened up Gronk.Edelman majorly helped keep the LA defense on the field, which ultimately helped them pull away in the end. There's so many little factors outside of stats.Marcus Peter's was 1v1 on him a lot...I love Hogan (wish he was still a bill) but Peters is 2 classes above him in talent and skillI also noticed that most of the Rams pass looks were based off of a DB or s LB losing eye discipline on a PA or a pre snap motion and not due to route trees getting DBs and LBs crossed up at times and man did the Pats d never lose eye discipline so alot of those easy throws were just not thereI‚Äôve always heard passes defensed too, prob the same thingOofThat man had a family!Fucking roasted. Just ask Bill who his favorite special teams player is and he will give you a TED talkThis is exactly how I feel about them and I can‚Äôt believe this is the first time I‚Äôve seen this opinion here. People keep talking about Brady as if he‚Äôs the only reason they have 6 but forget that Bellichick is building a complete team almost every year. And his guys almost always make the right play or show up at the right time. It‚Äôs insane. This is a bit of a fallacy though. Name one other QB who is considered elite with a WR core of: Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Philip Dorsett, Cordarrelle Patterson.   He had a legit #1 for like 2 years and put up historic passing numbers. Only if you narrow the scope of BB without brady to fit an argument. As a head coach without Brady he has a losing record.   Less notably, he won 11 with Cassell on a previously *undefeated* team who then went and won 11 again with the Chiefs.  Furthermore, he won 2 with Garropolo **who then went undefeated when traded to the worst team in the NFL**.  That makes it hard to say "BB won with backups" when those backups did the same thing outside the system. Hahahahaha get himKam was out of his mind good that playoff season (and to his credit, I only remember Smith *because* of that postseason). Kam deserved it.http://i.imgur.com/2QW959m.pngDude that was like four ^^^African generations agoHe had a terrible game even when you account for his OL playing terribly. He was making poor decisions all game and his passes were coming out ugly. That pick was just as much on him as his OL. As soon as that ball left his hands you knew it was going to be picked.I'm curious to see how he rebounds from this. Running around in the backfield did him no favors either. And everyone keeps saying how no one was open, on that play he refused to throw and took a sack that ended up netting them a 20 yard punt, Gerald Everett the TE (#81) was wide fucking open while Goff had as clean a pocket as you could ask for, watch the [Madden-cam replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffAzg-B3Dac).It's a compelling case I prefer PPD to points scored. I find it to be much more indicative of overall offensive potency. Using PPD, the Rams were 3rd behind both the Saints and the Chiefs and by a pretty wide margin. The rams didn't have 527, the Saints did.   2018:  Chiefs: 565  Saints: 527  Rams 504  Woops you're right. > if Edelman couldn‚Äôt keep the offense on the field in the first three quarters, that‚Äôs a lot more quick outs for the Pats, and the defense probably doesn‚Äôt play as well.  I know the NFL is all about offense... but are we basically giving credit for the defense holding the Rams to three points... to the offense?>	he did a really good job working Hekkers punt  I‚Äôm a pats fan so I don‚Äôt want to nitpick your Edelman praise but is the consensus he did a really good job?  He let a few go that bounced 10+ yds for the rams and I remember at least one he returned for a loss.   He didn‚Äôt play badly or muff any punts and had a few good returns. Not bad by any means, but not great either. Good defenses make good offenses look bad.They were getting outplayed on nearly every play. The Rams fucked up a lot but give credit to the amazing defensive performance the Patriots just displayed.Imo the rams didnt make adjustments but the pats did and that's why they won. Exactly! Games can be exciting without a ton of touchdowns. I called it exactly that brady was going to score on that second to last drive too. On top of our wr1 and fourntette was hurt a lot. Blake was playing fine then everyone died so he was all that was left to blame That‚Äôs a nasty play, he ran all the way across the field.  I hate the pats but by god they understand assignments and bill knows how to get the most of his guys...pats are a special teamJason McCourty balled out on that play breaking up that other pass too.To be fair Goff missed cooks who was running down the middle of the field wide open for like 5 full seconds That was hugeeeeeeThis makes me sadI mean the defense was solid all game and if it was for Most Valuable Unit, they'd get it.  But Edelman was more of a standout receiver than any particular defensive player.  I mean it's probably was (1) Edelman, (2) Gilmore, (3) Gronk, (4) Hightower, (5) JMac, (6) Van Noy, (7) Michel, (8) Burkhead, (9) DMac, (10) Flowers, (11) Slater, (12) Wise.  (And yeah I apologize to the O-line, but without watching all-22 it's hard to judge.)  EDIT:  (1) Edelman, (2) Gilmore, (3) Gronk, (4) Hightower, (5) JMac, (6) Van Noy, (7) Michel, (8) *Brady*, (9) *Andrews*, (10) Burkhead, (11) DMac, (12) Flowers, (13) Slater, (14) *Ryan Allen*, (15) Wise.He was already [2nd in career playoff receptions](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_career_playoffs.htm) and now is [2nd in career playoff receiving yards](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career_playoffs.htm).  Rice is also [first in receiving playoff TDs with 22 while Edelman is far behind in a multiway tie for 43rd place with 5, though Gronk is tied for #2 with 12](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_td_career_playoffs.htm)Just when I thought that couldn't get more funny, along comes /u/Riggs909/u/sim888 has a discipleGod damn it üòÇ this is better than the original You laugh but this image is actually a prophecyI needed this, thank youIf I'm remembering correctly, Andrew Luck's barber was infact a member of the Union army later in the war. Seriously.   I'm pretty sure that rams defense was gassed physically and mentally already by half time simply because of the number of punts their offense produced. The big play, homerun style of today's NFL has made people forget how important time of possession and field position can be. Drives that don't end in a score can still be a win if they change field position, but people are just our here like "doesn't matter; didn't score".Dope rhyme analysis. Got anymore?BB will never get enough credit for the dynasty, imo. Brady is important, for sure, because he's the core that Belichick builds around; but the man consistently has found players from nowhere thst turn into studs as soon as they play for Belichick. It's no coincidence, the man is amazing.The Randy Moss years were my favorite!lol omg thank you so much for this image That's just theorycrafting nonsense  Earlier he was hurling the ball for completions on a good drive and Romo was talking about how you just gotta get it out there  Magical plays are great until they turn into picks. Then it's "wtf were they thinking with that pass"  Turns out it isn't that easy to know your ball is going to get intercepted when you're looking past a crowd of people, 20-40 yards downfield  And he never threw the ball away when doing that. It was aggravating.That 19 yard sack where he ran around for like 15 seconds was probably just a rookie mistake but damn that was one of the worst sacks I've ever seenPlus it's not even *offensive points* scored, it's total points.   Out of boredom here's the offensive scoring rankings based on that list (and with the additions of the top 3 from this year)    Team | Raw Score | Defensive TDS | Return TDs | Adjusted Score ----|---------|-------------|----------|-------------- '13 Broncos|	606	|2|    2|	578 '07 Patriots|	589	|6|	2|	533 '18 Chiefs|	   565	|4|	1|	530 '11 Saints|	547		|3|	1|	519 '98 Vikings|556	        |5|	1|	514 '00 Rams	|540		|2|	2|	512 '11 Packers	|560		|5|	2|	511 '16 Falcons	|540		|5|	0|	505 '12 Patriots	|557		|6|	2|	501 '18 Rams	|527		|4|	0|	499 '18 Saints	|504		|1|	0|	497 '04 Colts	|522		|3|	1|	494 '99 Rams	|526		|8|	3|	449  None of the teams recorded a safety.What‚Äôs the D in PPD? Down?You've got that backwards bud.  Chiefs: 565  Rams: 527  Saints: 504  [espn](http://www.espn.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/seasontype/2) [pfr] (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/index.htm) [nfl] (https://www.nfl.com/standings)No, he is saying it helped, and the defence played well as a whole. Edelman was clearly the most irreplaceable player on offence; not sure I can point to his equivalent on defence.Right? The reason Goff looked like trash is because we took away the run game, kept pretty great coverage on the receivers, and rushed the pocket on almost every play.Bill had nothing to do with that play. JMcCourty wasn't supposed to be on Cooks, someone else blew their assignment and McCourty saw it.I watched former Bears first round LB bust Shea McClellin contribute to a Pats super bowl a few years back. It gets better when you start to see it isn‚Äôt just your organization. The disrespect to Ryan AllenI don‚Äôt think Ryan Allen is getting enough credit either.  Those punts were as accurate as Brady‚Äôs throws.The Rams punter should have been MVP.This is fair, Edelman was the only receiver that did anything of value That's actually a pretty good order.lol...i made datit's just so grossThe nuances of football are often lost on people. That's what I'm not getting. It's ironic to bring up the stat argument while being blinded by the intangibles of the game/the little things that make a huge difference. Both teams also got some pretty important punts.  How many punts ended up putting the other team inside their 15? 10? 5?  You have to play different when you start every drive in "a long sack could give them 2 pts" territory.  Kicking from their 40 vs the w0 because elements was giving a first down is the reason why when the rams would finally get a small play or two, they were almost never in fg range (despite having a very good kicker).  10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to remember the name2013 Broncos and 2007 Patriots had amazing offensive displays in their Super Bowl too.[deleted]Points per Drive PPD = postpartum depressionWell. I blame this garbage ass website.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/247sports.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/ContentGallery/NFL-offensive-scoring-rankings-2018-121722415/Amp/I'd have to say Gilmore is that guy on defense. Gilmore. He was lights-out all night, and made back-to-back plays to stop the Rams last real chance to come back (broke up a potential TD pass and picked the very next play).  Both of those plays (Hell, McCourty's bananas break-up a few drives earlier of a sure TD even) had bigger impacts, IMO, than Edelman's catches largely in the first half (on drives that mostly came away empty).Devin blew the coverage. Twin senses. Watch it again homie, I‚Äôm admiring McCourty for that exact reason... he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there, yet he made the play. I‚Äôm not glorifying bill, but that‚Äôs bills way of doing things. He lets his guys know the impossible is possible. Same way a 6th rounder turns Into the goat. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre paying enough attention to these dudesThe worst part with Van Noy is he is thriving in our coaches system lolThe best is when you sign former pats SB winners and then they just aren't anything special at all. Aka Casillas, Vareen, SolderShea was a great piece to have while he was here, it sucks concussions ended his career.Ryan Allen aka Ray Allen Aka god country deserves the mvp. Field position mattered so much this game, but of course people gonna bitch.If the rams won I was absolutely on board with giving hekker the mvp. He kept the rams in that game with his cannon of a leg Well also Gronk (yes not WR but still receiving TE) who went 6 for 7 with 87 yards, not that much worse than Edelman's 10 for 12 with 141 yards.Except I left out Brady.  He did have the first pass INT, but otherwise made good decisions all game.  Probably around 8 or 9.THERE'S ONLY 11 MINUTES OF ACTUAL GAME PLAY!!!!!1#1!sucked cuz none of the people i was with really cared for the game that much. would've been a lot more fun watching with people than can appreciate stuff like good blocking or d-line stunts or simple qb pressures and pass deflections.üòé üî• LIT üî• üòé We sure taught the Seahawks a lesson that year!Hahaha, thanks for the appreciation but it's a pretty lazy table. I guarantee there's at least one missed XP or scoring ST trick play that I've missed.  Go drink a big glass of water, sober you will appreciate it in the morning.TIL my mom is a top ten offense of all timeThis comment makes the most sense out of all of them....I like the fact that he made the play like it was business as usual. He didn't have to do some lobster dance to celebrate his achievement. I still have very angry feelings every time Pat Chung makes a good play. Dude was straight up ass for us. It was exciting there were big plays they were spread out on the defensive side of the ball and they weren't flashy enough for many.Yeah that's part of why I stopped going to parties for super bowls. Watched this game with just my dad and we were just commenting on the great defensive plays, and the phenomenal punting and of course Edelman being a beast2013 Broncos offense so dominating they scored in the first 12 seconds of the Super Bowl. Fastest any team has scored in a Super Bowl.My cigarette burns are enough to win Offensive MVP.
r/nfl, [](/CLE) Browns receive| [](/HOU) Texans receive ---|--- **QB** Brock Osweiler| 4th round pick 6th round pick|  2018 2nd round pick |   https://twitter.com/nfldraftscout/status/839939031186178048  Salary Implications:   [](/CLE) Browns | [](/HOU) Texans  ---|--- -$16MM cap space| -$9MM dead cap  | +$16MM cap space  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cleveland-browns/brock-osweiler-9867/ From Shefter's Facebook:  NFL stunner: Texans trade QB Brock Osweiler AND a 2018 second-round pick to Cleveland for the Browns to take Osweiler‚Äôs $16M salary of Houston‚Äôs books, per league sources. The move clears out millions in salary-cap space for Houston to intensify efforts to sign former Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, per sources. To be exact, Houston saves $16 million in cash and $10 million against their cap this season. The Texans also will get the Browns‚Äô fourth-round pick this year in exchange for their own 6th-round pick. So Cleveland gets Osweiler‚Äôs contract, a 2018 second-round pick and a 2017 sixth-round pick, and Houston gets Cleveland‚Äôs 2017 fourth-round pick, saves $10 million in salary-cap space and $16 million in cash. Cleveland is not committed to keeping Osweiler and is likely to try to trade him, per sources. If so, it would turn into a basketball-like trade in which NBA teams routinely trade contracts to get them off their books; only it rarely, if ever, happens in the NFL. It‚Äôs hard to remember in the salary-cap era another team when a team traded a contract to get it off its books. But Houston was so anxious to rid itself of Osweiler and move on to its next quarterbacking chapter that it is giving Cleveland extra picks to take him and his contract. The Browns headed into this free-agent signing period with over $100 million worth of salary-cap space and would struggle to spend it all. Now they can devote some of it to Osweiler‚Äôs contract and acquiring extra draft picks from Houston. But this is one of the most, if not the most, creative trade in NFL history.  https://www.facebook.com/AdamSchefter/posts/1429549650431005 Romo to Houston confirmed I love how it specifically says it's to take him off the books, and not to play quarterback haha.Lol, you know you're bad when a team pays a 2nd to be rid of youTexans rn: http://i.imgur.com/vBlxV8k.gifLMFAO HOUSTON IS GONNA GET ROMOI dont believe anything today. So the Texans literally get nothing except getting rid of his contract?  Didn't someone make a post about this like two weeks ago?  It actually makes sense for both teams.  Edit: [Here's the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5uzkux/could_the_browns_trade_for_brock_osweiler/)   Edit 2: The Texans actually got a 4th back. Denver is gonna lose a QB battle to Houston for the second year in a row  Because Houston PAID A SECOND ROUNDER to ditch the QB from the first battle Will Brocks last name fit on the back of the famous jersey?WTFCALLED IT! I FUCKING CALLED IT!  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5uzkux/could_the_browns_trade_for_brock_osweiler/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpageWE ARE SO FUCKEDHoly shit they did itWHERE IS THAT GIANTS FAN THAT FUCKING CALLED THIS SHIT WEEKS AGO  /u/Crossfire912 is a fucking wizard!  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5uzkux/could_the_browns_trade_for_brock_osweiler/HOLY FUUUUUUCKWUTWelp there's the Romo play  Haha Brock  This day just keeps getting amazingBah Gawd is that Romo's music? FIVE. D. CHESS.Didn't someone recommend this shit on /r/NFL like a month ago? But I think it was a 3rd round pick, not a second round pick to get rid of the cap space.  Remember: Browns are getting 2nd round pick to eat the cap space. It's a pure $ move for them even if he does suck.Free Agency is almost as fun as watching football.When you're so bad that you are traded for free and the Browns don't even want you.Five minutes, 800 comments... Holy fuck.HOLY SHIT ROMO GOIN TO HOUSTONThis is the best day of my life. 22 minutes and 2k comments?  No one will ever even see this.  Osweiler Superbowl 2017Brock just made $30mm for doing nothing. Don't laugh at him too hard. This...this actually distracted me from the fact that the Atlanta Falcons blew a 25-point lead in the Super Bowl.Shut the fuck up.HOLY SHITHELLO ROMOBAH GOD THATS SAM HINKIES MUSICSo now the Browns Picks are:   2017: 1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,6,+6.  2018: 1,2,2,2,+2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7. OH MY GOD. Thank you Cleveland, take good care of him. Holy shit he's verified Hey /u/JaySpike,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.#Im seeing r/nfl stuff on /r/all.  And its Browns related. LO-Fucking-LYou finally got your Super Bowl ring Cleveland!WHAT THE CRAP BALLSHOLY SHIT SCHEFTY BOMBNICE ONE BROWNS.That has to feel kind of crappy from Osweiler's POV. You're so overpaid a team traded away a 2nd round pick just to get rid of you. All can be tied to all the money they wasted on Brock. Oh my god. When you're such an awful quarterback that your team has to give up a 2nd round pick to send you to Cleveland of all teams, to undo the mistake in signing you in the first place. lmaoTHIS IS WHY WE F5Um...NOOOOOOOO! ROOOMMMMOOOOOOOOO!lol Brock being passed around like a two bit whore. A red headed step child. A black sheep. Ugly duckling.   Whatever you wanna call it, sad day for Brock. This is either gonna crush his desire to play or he'll try and nut up. Can't feel good to be traded just to be gotten rid of and then knowing you're not even gonna play for the team you just signed with either.[Rapoport](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/839943252212056065) - The Browns may just release him straight upYEAH BABY F5.    **Didn't someone predict this type of trade a couple months ago?**   EDIT:  Https://reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5uzkux/could_the_browns_trade_for_brock_osweiler/   /u/Crossfire912   He even predicted it would be the Browns. Amazing. WOAH"Deandre what's that sticking out your pocket?"And suddenly we are priced out of the Romo sweepstakes.  Great move by Cleveland, Sit Osweiler on the bench for a year then cut him, free 2nd round pick for a team with lots of cap spaceBAH GAWD THATS BROCK LOBSTERS MUSICTHIS IS WHY THE MAN HAS TWO PHONESThis will be the top post in /r/NFL history I just want to hop on for the ride.  **Go Browns**I love how the NFL-only fans I know are totally confused by what Cleveland is doing, but NBA fans I know are all "CLEVELAND TRUSTS THE PROCESS!!!!"please be real. what did we give up?What a great move, Browns look to be run by competent people for the first time in a while. This is fucking glorious. I'M HYPED AS FUCK.How bad must it feel to know that your team had to throw in 2 draft picks for someone to take you after just one year?Is it just me, or is this a surprisingly intelligent move by the Browns?This is so embarrassing for Rick Smith. The fact that he is giving away picks to a team to simply take a QB that he overpaid for that he overpaid for largely because he hasn't invested in young QBs in the draft is such a huge indictment of his performance as a GM. I hope his leash is getting short because I would be furious about all the moves leading up to this if I were a Texans fanBrowns are in FULL kevin costner modeSince when does /r/nfl show up in /r/all? I thought it was specifically opted-outWut.Remember someone proposed this in this sub a few weeks ago and people said salary dumps don't happen in the NFLThe Browns just paid $16 million for a 2nd round pick.  *Amaaaazing*.what is happening hereHERE COMES TONYThat just happened. Lobster is on the menu in Cleveland.No one's going to see this but I just remembered that Brock is a character in pokemon Can't wait until Browns sign Romo just to Troll Houston. Whoa, since when does /r/NFL show up on /r/all?You know what else I like about this? Everyone's talking about the Browns trading Brock on, but with the QB draft class what it is this year, this essentially gives them another year to gradually rebuild and reap the benefits next year.  Twelve months from now, Cleveland still have loads of cap space, loads of picks, they can cut Brock for nothing, they'll have Garrett and others from this year's draft with a year under their belt, and THEN they can grab a long-term QB.THAT ONE GUY CALLED ITThis dude called it omg   https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5uzkux/could_the_browns_trade_for_brock_osweiler/HOLY FUCKwhat the hell?Holy shitOH FUCK WHAT?!?!?!? IT'S HAPPENING!!!!!!Garrapollo to Houston?Apparently the Browns were, "more interested in the second-rounder" according to Mike Garafolo. Brock isn't even good enough for the Browns... So this means Cutler to the Broncos, right guys?    Brock head must be mind fucked right now, he got traded for a team that wanted the draft pick, not himself.  OMG thats hardThis seems like a remarkable trade that immediately puts both teams in a better position.This is honestly the best deal I've seen Cleveland make in my lifetime. My dad has been a Browns fan since the '60s and is dancing in the living room. This is definitely a culture change day for Cleveland. I.... think both teams win here.> Cleveland is not committed to keeping Osweiler and is likely to try to trade him, per sources.   How can they trade him for anything of value when the Texans had to give up a pick just for someone to take him away?This needs more upvotes.  Two posts with "This is why we F5" sitting at 50+ and 200+, and you're down here providing actual details with single digit karma.This is such an odd trade, but it looks like both teams benefitHas anyone made sure Sam Hinkie didn't secretly infiltrate the Browns front office?Semi-hilarious to call a routine trade from an NBA perspective, "one of the most, if not the most, creative trade in NFL history."This is such an NBA trade. Craaaaaaazy to see a contract dump like this in the NFL.Don't forget Cousins. Still seems iffy whats going on in Washington. Jimmy G, O'Brien runs the same system Jimmy G has been in his whole career.Houston spooky confirmed Cutler is available. Free agent, too.Brock Osweiler CPA, confirmedWhat would make this even better is if he somehow got his shit together this offseason and became a franchise level QB for you guys.it's not his level of talent, it's his level of talent in relation to his level of pay.THAT IS EXACTLY ME RIGHT NOW  ROMO IS COMING TO HOUSTON BBBuddy, you couldn't be more correct.Rarely does a reaction .gif actually make me laugh out loud. Perfect.CAN CONFIRM ROMO TIME FUCKERSINB4 ROMO-TEXANS SUPERBOWL WIN OVER THE COWBOYS. [deleted]Wouldn't it be wild if they signed Cutler instead lolRomo, Cutler cut  Lobster to Browns   What's next, Brady to Rams?Right? Browns get a pick and can sit on brock, they have the cash. Pretty good deal both ways imo. Real NBA style tradeThey get cap space glorious cap space Yes someone made a post about it and everyone called him a moron. Happens all the time in the NBA, it's about time it started happening in the NFL.I swear i read this on here and it totally makes sense when you think about why it works for both teams.  But its something you would do in a video game not real life.Denver would be loving that they missed out on Osweiler. Given Romo's injury history, it might turn out to be another good missed opportunity. Denver didn't lose last year. Y'all won by not getting Brockster.  I'm betting Houston wins this year though and nabs Romo.  Then the year after that, once Romo has been broken in half in the divisional round of the playoffs, there'll have to be a rubber match.  Maybe Brees gets sick of having to drag a terrible team every year and is looking for a new conference?Don't you have to actually start to get on it?It no longer exists apparently OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE HERE COME THE BROWNSThis is totally setting up for RomoCould making room for romo  Edit: has Bouye been signed yet or he is still a free agent Somebody suggested this in the offseason before and got absolutely shitted on. Good on him.Holy shit the Texans thought Brock was really THAT badThey just bought a 2nd round pick. Someone posted this idea for a 3rd a few weeks ago and everyone said they'd be stupid not to do it.  Now they do it for a 2nd and everyone is laughing at them  edit - okay people stopped laughing at themGPODAWUNDBrowns finally score and find out it's their cousin and she's not on the pill.It's happening.Cleveland's GM definitely read this.

Hopefully not from the Warriors blowing a 3-1 lead thoThis is actually really good for the Browns. You have the cap space to still build regardless, and you get a massive asset to acquire more talent in a deep draft. Osweiler will be cut after the season anyway.This is a good deal for the Browns. No one should be shitting on them. They basically bought a 2nd and a possible starting QB for the upcoming season and they only have him on the books for one year. So the Browns can draft an entire offense and defense over the next 2 years. Cool. yall just gave us a free 2nd rounder. Thank you!I can see it now...  >Brock, how does it feel to be unwanted and considered super over paid for your skill level?

Bwhahaha. they eat the cap hit and move him cheap?first day on reddit? 7 minutes...Be patient, it always evens out.Romo and Cousins to Houston Or revisiting Garopolo with the Bill OBrien NE connection If I'm reading this right, Houston gave up a 2nd to get Cleveland to take Osweiler.   1) It seems unlikely they'd give up multiple firsts for Jimmy G in addition to that.  2) Seems like they did this to get rid of Brock Lobster's cap hit. They've gotta be clearing room for someone with a big contractBut they can get Romo for free (higher cap hit doesn't really matter since Brock is gone)God. We get rid of one unproven backup only to be replaced by another. For at least the first 3 days> CPA  The last thing you'd want is an accountant that is as inaccurate as Brock.I would love that so much, as truly unlikely as it isLOL This would actually be the most hilarious thing.

Absorb terrible contracts for second round picks. My thoughts exactly, I'm glad an NFL team finally did something like this. A league with more movement is more interesting to me as a fan. This is like that one time where the Warriors offloaded Andris Biedrins, Richard Jefferson and Brandon Rush to the Jazz and threw in a bunch of picksso lets recap the Brock situation for the Texans:   1. Throw 18 million away.   2. Throw  2nd round pick away.   3. profit?lol I feel so vindicated Agreed. Tony Romo has played 5 games in 2 years. He could turn out to be the Tony Romo of old, but I really doubt it. He is 36 and has a history of back injuries. He could have a great year for them but I think the majority of Texans fans going crazy over this are really setting themselves up for lots of disappointment. I like Romo and hope he does well, but common sense tells me he has hardly played football in live games in 2 years and he has back problems. Doesn't bode well. Ya keeping Simian and using the extra money to bolster the line might honestly be the best decision.  WHO KNOWSYes and it was retired anyway.Yeah the owner retired it after the Cavs came back from 3-1 stating it as foundational moment for the new Cleveland sports era and wanting to get rid of some of the negativity.SUSHI FROM THE TOP FUCKING ROPEWE GOT THESE LINEMAN.

Like at all?Right? I don't get it. Great trade from the Browns, especially if they're not using that cap space on anybody good.   EDIT: And they got a 6th rounder too, not that that's much.They get a free second round pick and essentially shift cap space from this year to next. This is great for the browns.

Not just that.  They paid $16M for to trade a 4th round pick for a sixth this year and a second next year AND a backup QB (or starter if he somehow improves on their team).  Basically zero risk for them even if he never sees the field.YOU DID IT, REDDITAt the time nobody liked it, and we used it for Manziel so nobody liked it later. That 1st turned into Manziel so it's a lose/loseMaybe even better. This was a great deal for them, but it was great for Houston too.  Dumping Trent for a 1st was fantastic for the Browns, and really stupid on the Colts part.Isn't that what "winning" a trade is? Improving your situation?True.  But you get what i'm saying.Fail to see how it's a loss for the texans. They got rid of a player that did nothing to benefit them in an attempt to get better with more cap space. This is a win win for both teams. Texans have been making the playoffs fairly consistently recently. Your comment is ridiculous. Which I guess is a win compared to the current situation???I'd eat this dogshit for 16 million.Oh, I did not realize they could do that.  I thought the salary would follow him to his new team.  That would make more sense.  TIL.  Thanks!Honestly, if you're already paying Osweiler anyways, why not keep him? He's young and is probably the best QB on the Browns roster at the moment.This is why we fucking f5No he's probably a grizzled old vet who's sick of you new school shit. The QB Feud of the DecadeI think it's actually Romo's cousin signing with Houston.    Gil Romo.  Not well known but a heck of a nice guy.Romo, Cousins, and Garappolo to Houston Yeah, if anything, CLE may have purchased these picks to help get Jimmy G, not Houston.Romo and A.P?Hey Jim, so instead of submitting those invoices to accounts payable I defied the laws of physics and *threw* a fumbleFranchise level QB for the Browns? Never say never..  Except in this case. This case is a for sure never. So would I.   edit: I've apparently pissed off many many Cowboys fans with this three word post. Just to clarify, I've been a fan of this team since 1976. I have never once cheered for another team over the Cowboys in all my 40 years. I appreciate everything Romo did for the franchise and want to see him succeed wherever he goes. I don't think Cowboy fans would be that upset. It would shut up a lot of critics. Hank Hill can only get so erect...Aikman.[deleted]Except 2nd round picks are actually valuable in the NFL!My biggest gripe with the NFL is trades. It's difficult to do trade. Especially because of the difficulty of learning the playbook after the season begins.    But off-season, let's see some more trades! I wonder how you could loosen up the rules to allow for more trades.And now they can load up, sign up Romo to a Super Bowl team lacking a QB, and challenge. I'd gladly give up a 2nd for that (assuming they get Romo)Have any March madness predictions? The thing is, if he manages to stay healthy, his upside is huge, especially with a great defense backing him up. I kind of want Denver to take the chance, it's not like Seimien is gonna lead us to the promised land. Plus, if Lynch is actually good, he can learn a ton from Romo.That makes me sad.  I mean, I know it started out as a really negative thing but I think it could be a cool tradition eventually or something.  Definitely a reminder of what things were like before and how that could be worse?Thats bullshit. I want the jersey to continue.I mean how is Cleveland supposed to sustain itself through the winters without the negativity?TOPE SUICIDAAND ROMO FINISHES HIM OFFBAH GAWD KING! THAT FRANCHISE HAS A FAMILY!GOD AS MY WITNESS THE OFFSEASON IS BROKEN IN HALFYup. Looks like I'll be driving down there for a game this year to see Romo one last time.Texans become SB ContnedersYea makes sense, different conference, still a Texas guy. On a good team. Good for Romo.> If he's good, you found your QB.  lmaoI like to believe that the Browns read this post and then decided to do it.900 upvotes and a bunch of people agreeing.  >Absolutely shitted on  uhh ok.Possibly even worseMost of us think it was McNair (and Rick by proxy I suppose). Reeked of owner interference. Rumor my ass.  BoB is a monster of a coach and would never f that up so terribly.We get their 4th this year so not bad at all.Thank you.Yep! I just told my coworker about this and he said it was stupid because Osweiler is bad. I'm like, you don't get it, man!  They have *wayyyy* more than enough cap space to absorb Osweiler's contract. Keep him on the roster this year, cut him next year (I think penalty free, right?), and get a 2nd rounder for doing it.  Cleveland has essentially just bought the Texans 2018 2nd round pick from them. The player involved is just a number, really.So they fucked their cousin, but she's a solid 9/10?Yup. Cleveland could straight up cut him if they want to. and only mildly heart wrenching for us (mostly because we're out picks to fix a mistake)>I tried lmao  -Brock Osweiler, 2017You'll get it next time! SADKNOWPretty sure Bill is a Giants fan so it could be.*raises Bortles*Maybe the Browns or Texans GM reads reddit and just stole the idea from /u/Crossfire912. Or maybe /u/Crossfire912 is actually the Texans or Browns GM.He's an Eagles fan, so limp handed WRs and no rings.  Wide receiver you say? Didn't think you'd  know what that word meantFuck you. Also you're absolutely correct. NFLstrodamusMake it lobsters.It wasn't luck because the GM of the browns read his post and thought it was a good idea.I am so happy this sub exists. Didn't even know!You just reminded me I'm seeing them perform live in a few months.  Fuck yeah, so stoked!!!/r/ofcourseitsathingYou know there's some jr. level front office guy that's a redditor who is taking all the credit for his idea. Reposting IRL"hey, what about this?" - Browns GMMONEY TASTES GOODPlus a half-way competent, non-injury prone QB to either use or trade.[deleted]At this point I don't even care. Just glad we got rid of him.[deleted]Texas losing to Kansas?ALL I WANT IS PRYORThese Cleveland folks seem like a disgruntled bunch.I still remember all of the tanking talk after we traded Richardson. Fans from other teams were coming into our sub to give their condolences. Manziel made that franchise a lot of $quid pro quo. We help them, they pay us.Watch Brock lead the browns to the Superbowl I'm not against it.. take Trubs at 12 and roll into the season with Osweiler/Kessler/TrubsIf we could squeeze another pick or young prospect....then trade him. If not, I agree we should give him a shot.It's no contest. Kirk has Julie. JJ Watt pats Romo on the back. Romo to the IR for 5 years.Save a game ball for ol' Gil, wouldja?Scrappy.Fuck it, every QB to Houston.[deleted]The ole triple barrell shotgun formation  Oh man that would be spicy lol you are not wrongYeah, honestly. Count me in. I think I'm gonna cheer for a Romo Super Bowl win primarily over anything else next year. Dude's taken so much shit over his career and I think I just may have more loyalty to him than I do to the Boys. At least until he's won a title. After that then I'll have some real closure :')Maybe not Cowboys fans on Reddit, but loud, obnoxious Cowboys fans would be sooooooo butt-hurt.This Superbowl brought to you by Propane and Propane AccessoriesTouchdownShould probably hook Watt up with some while you're at it.AND SOME BANDAIDS WITH FIRETRUCKS ON EMDraymond came from the second round. And his nut shots are instrumental to the warriors success.TELL THAT TO RICHAUN HOLMESYeah well the Browns didn't even get 2 2nd roundersUNC all the way. Just my opinion, Romo has big upside but I think the chances of that are slim.It was fun when it was just us mocking ourselves, but it started to be a thing that NFL fans around the country started paying attention to and mocking us for. It became annoying at that point. It's the same with the Cleveland Tourism Video and Factory of Sadness rant, funny in the context of being from the area. Obnoxious outsiders ruined it though.I bet you him retiring that Jersey is the reason the Indians blew a 3-1 lead in the World Series.Cleveland power plants run on the salt of Browns fan's tears. MA.. MA... MIAAAMAMA MIA!*and fade to commercial break*PHRASINGI'm actually moving to Houston this summer. Talk about perfect. Gonna teach them how to say good byeAgreed, franchise Qb, true number 1 receiver, top 10 runningback, plus they get Watt back.If he turns out good, that would be the most Anti-Browns thing in the world. I really hope this trade marks the day the Browns turned it all around.  And we look back in a few years at their third straight AFC championship and remember that they got their franchise QB for nothing and also gained a 2nd round pick.  It's a step up from the homeless man. I mean, they take advice to draft Manziel from random homeless guys on the street, so it doesn't seem a stretch that they would do this.It was absolutely McNair. He was publicly defending Brock with ridiculous statements late into the season. win-win for 2 AFC teams  I hate it..Youre going to need a new username soon!> cut him next year (I think penalty free, right?)  Correct.  [After this upcoming season, he can be cut free and clear.](http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cleveland-browns/brock-osweiler-9867/)Les Cousins DangereuxThis is the funniest comment I think I've ever seen on this sitewoodywipingtearswithmoney.rarGEEEEEEEEENE!! AHHHHHHHH!!!http://i.imgur.com/6bzbUgT.jpgLobstrodamus.I would love for the Browns to say they got the idea from him. Doesn't seem too far fetchedSame!!Really is one of the most even trades I've ever seen.  Shefter said we're going to cut him anyway, so Houston basically paid us a future 2nd and swapped a 4th and 6th to eat the contract.  We came into this with $100+ million in cap space that we will unlikely spend anyway, so who cares.  WIN-WIN> Cutler.  For your sake I hope that isn't the case. If you guys go for Cutler over Romo, I'll forever lose faith in your FO ever finding a good QB. I'll love it, but it'll be a shame.You have no idea.[The thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1mo7d1/browns_rb_trent_richardson_to_indy_for_colts/) for those curious.  Some highlights:  >Cleveland suicide watch  >And Hoyer is all like "what the fuck am I supposed to do now?"  > I don't think I've ever been so fucking pissed at this franchise. Two fucking games in and they're blowing up the team. Fuck Banner. Kill Weeden. Fuck Greg Little. Fuck Oniel Cousins. Fuck Buster Skrine. Fuck this.  >This is like trading your car for better tires.  Some prescience:  > Lombardi wants any QB not named Weeden at this point...definitely tanking for Bridgewater, and if they miss out...maybe Johnny Football with the mid-round Colts pick?  > If we ever wasted a high pick Manziel Id burn all browns memorabilia I have.  *Ouch*, the Browns actually had two chances to pick up Bridgewater.  Only to grab Justin Gilbert and Johnny Vegas.  And I finally found one.  /u/msh6465, way way way down, below where you have to load new comments, said this:  > 2000 replies. Front page of r/all. This will never be seen by anyone. I can say whatever I want.  > This was a great move. Fuck the haters. Everyone loves him, but no one actually watches Browns games, so all they hear is the hype. I'm pretty sure we can bring any random joe off the street and average his blistering 49 yards a game. Great move by the front office. Not many would have the balls to actually pull the trigger, it makes he happy to know that we have people who won't give in to fan pressure and will do whats best for the team. Go Browns.  So congrats to you msh6465, for being the voice of reason.Yeah that was definitely a savvy trade by you guys. You figured out that Richardson was garbage like 3 days before the rest of the world. I remember that trade as being solidly in the Colts' favor at the time‚ÄîI thought they had found their next Edgerrin James.Just imagine if they had used that draft pick for a QB.  Which helps their owners but not the team.[Required by law in any Manziel-related thread](https://fat.gfycat.com/PleasedCraftyDiamondbackrattlesnake.webm)lolI would love to see a Lions V. Browns Super Bowl.  It would just be both fan bases politely congratulating the other up until the game.Let's not get *too* carried away now. I was wondering this too.  Like who are you going to find that needs a QB *more* than you guys?  Romo bringing Jessica Simpson out of retirement. Can someone please explain this meme about Cousins and his wife? Brady to Houston? ok no take backsI bet having your opposition settle for a 5th round pick will help them win it allGET YOUR HANDS OFF MY DAK!Every Brady back up to Houston, forever I think Osweiler has talent, I just think BoB's offense was too complex for him. He was fine with pre-snap reads, and showed flashes of brilliance when he had time post-snap... but he isn't great with post-snap reads, and gets flustered in the pocket with terrible footwork.  A dumbed down play-action centric offense would be great for him (as it was in Denver).Barbecue at my place!  Don't you dare bring Coors light.I would be so happyI like the Texans, I love Romo and want to see him get a ring to shut up the idiots who think he isn't a HoF QB. You now know how us Colts fans felt when Peyton went to Denver.yeah, facebook cowboys fans are a very different (and much larger) group than reddit cowboys fans.Isiah Thomas was the last pick in the draft... the last.And blowing 3-1 leads[deleted]Basically a "hes too gay to function"  "that was only okay when I said it" moment100% [deleted]I LOVE IT, MAURO!I spoke with Rikishi about Osweiler on the set of his new movie and he told me...I LOVE IT MARRO!( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)[deleted]That means that they need to go all in on OL during the draft. No excuses. I want a wall built around that man!Fuck that defense is gonna be so nastyfucking shitBrowns first ever team to defeat Belicheck in 4D chess.Was like WTF you are all insane because I misread and thought the Browns gave a 2nd lol. Damn what a great deal for the Browns.[I'm so excited!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/df/cf/04/dfcf047677188f55e4c30516a4c39de0.png)See, Jerry and Stephen? **This** is why you have cap room.  :(This Maeby a great trade.HE DID IT AGAIN!I love itMe too thanks![deleted]Yes. I actually laughed out loud.The 49ers have only Hoyer, so them.J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETSThat love isn't as pure as Kirk and Julie. You mean about the most beautiful love story in human history? You would also have to take Edelman, they're kind of a package deal.Jay Cutler, checking in!PBR it is! Neverrrrrr. I leave beer to the beer snobs anyway. I'll bring my deviled eggs, tho.  ;) The personal schadenfreude over the tears of all the shitty Cowboys fans who trashed him his whole career seeing Romo wreck our shit in a Super Bowl... that would probably be worth it tbhHe's not a HOF QB.. yet, but a ring could put him over the top.  And after today I can finally support Romo publically. He's one of the toughest damn quarterbacks of the modern era and all he did was get shit on constantly by NFL and Cowboy fans... now he can go to Houston and with that defense, Lamar Miller and Nuk, are instant contenders. [deleted]same with all fanbases, nobody actually agrees with facebook fansIsiah Thomas went 2nd overall in his. ISAIAH Thomas went lastAnd a guy who's actually won rings and Olympic Gold (Manu) was like the third to last guy picked in his draft.It really is the most sustainable way to treat the roads.[autistic screeching]30 for 30: Cleveland runs the 4DThink ahead like our FO: prepare to be u/No1ISN'T HE THE BEST?  *Ron Howard narrates*  He was far from the best.The Gang Signs JimmySame.We are rebuilding. We can roll with Hoyer, draft a second day project guy, and wait for Cousins/draft somebody next year. Kirk and Julie win in any situation Apparently, yes, that one. If we absolutely have to, I guess we can find a way to suffer through having Edelman.I want a little variety, so I'll bring Lone Star...Only if your recipe includes paprika on top, just like my momma used to make.lol, oh you Texas-bros. Almost brings a tear to my eye.  Hope we end up with Romo and gluck with your young'uns.OH, my Facebook is filled with idiot Cowboy fans. Those idiot fans would just blame Jerry for letting him go.  They're all about 20/20 hindsight not actual rational analysis or consistency.The draft is a crapshoot.  Once in a lifetime talents bust, and last round picks who are undersized become superstars.honestly... I WOULD LOVE IT!  That would be incredible if the browns were the team he finally blossoms into the megastar QB we all hoped he would be.  because a player no one cares about going to a team that no one cares about and it being the spark that catapults the browns to NFL powerhouse status... would be the most browns thing ever.hahahah totally read that as DeMarcus Cousins, not Kirk. And I was like, huh, there's a thought .....Greatest love story of our time. Julie Cousins is married to Kirk Cousins and they're the perfect couple. Something everyone should be aspiring to. I'll swing through Shiner on my way down and pick us up a couple cases of whatever is seasonal. Go Romo!like there's another way! Crapshoot is a bit of an overstatement, as I'm sure there is a pretty strong correlation between career success and draft position. If you look back at the last 20 #1 draft picks in the NBA you have two busts:  * Anthony Bennett * Greg Oden  And a few guys who had long NBA careers but clearly weren't the best pick in the draft:  * Andrea Bargnani * Andrew Bogut * Kwame Brown * Michael Olowokandi  But you also have a number of HoF or future HoF players:  * LeBron James * Yao Ming * Tim Duncan * AI  And then players that were multiple All Stars and may be HoF bound:  * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving * John Wall * Blake Griffin * Derrick Rose * Dwight Howard  All that to say, there are definitely busts and definitely players who have exceptional careers who were drafted very late, but most players drafted high have exceptional careers.I'm ashamed I didn't see it before

Congrats Buffalo.In the year 2000 a master table-maker built his masterpiece. The best table of all time.  Doug Flutie wasn't tall enough to reach it without a high seat however, so he had the table burned.  The table-maker cursed the Bills. They would never make the playoffs until all of the tables in Buffalo were smashed.  Miliseconds before Andy Dalton's 4th down pass, a drunken shirtless Bills fan smashed the final table in Buffalo while screaming, "GRONK SUCKS BRADYS ASSHOLE!"  And so the curse is lifted.My brother got a bloody nose celebrating that Cincy TD. My dad is crying in the living room. No tables are safe. Let‚Äôs go Bills.IM NOT CRYING AT A BAR WITH STRANGERS.

Me during the 4th and 12* TD "FUCKING ANDY DALTON!!!!"LORD DALTONBLESSED GINGER GODThat's Buffalo Bills legend Andy "Red Rifle" Dalton to you sir.I‚Äôve never been so happy about a Bengals TD in my life. That shit was orgasmic watching the Ravens hopes and dreams just mercilessly snuffed out so close to victory.   Edit: out not ourHe can get his dick sucked in Buffalo whenever he wantsTime to pray for Shady though.  He's our only chance.Andy Dalton just went clutch as fuck to get the Bills into the playoffs!!!  Congrats Bills, i'm happy for ya!The best part is in a few hours we will have made the playoffs two years in a row!!!This is amazing. Time to start Peterman thoI know I‚Äôm supposed to hate your team, and I do. But I was rooting for Cincy so hard because I hate the Ravens more. Yeah but think of what you guys have done, Mariners fans have suffered enough and now they're the longest drought in American sports.  Just kidding, you guys deserve it! Congrats! Super happy for you, as I am with any team who makes the playoffs after a while, I experienced it as a Saints fan pre-Brees/Payton.This sub would have completely lost its fucking mind if the Browns had won today. Who can hate the Bills?   Congrats Bills fans!! If we can‚Äôt get a Pennsylvania Civil War for the Super Bowl, let‚Äôs get a Bills/Vikings Super Bowl. Just imagine how crazy this place would be if the Browns made the playoffs. I think everyone would hop on that bandwagon.we're like the autistic kid who everyone is happy he scored a touchdown... this is my favoritehttp://media1.giphy.com/media/GQnsaAWZ8ty00/giphy.gifCongrats from this Vikings fan! Tell your brother to pinch the fleshy part of the nose for 10 minutes without letting go (set a timer, it always feels longer than it is). No need to tilt the head back. Bloody nose veteran here.Yeah I‚Äôm crying too ):CongratulationsIt's............   All worth it.Being a Steelers fan is a meme sometimes because of the playoff expectations. If we dont win, there is no question in my mind I want the bills to FUCKING SMOKE EVERYONEHappy cakeday fellow Bills broI'm bugging out!Jags first home playoff game in 18 years and they'll be hosting the Bills first playoff game in 18 years. What a way to top off an already wild year.  HAPPY FUCKING NEW YEAR You had me until the last sentence.  Don't play with my emotions like that.What makes it even more remarkable is I did get laid this past year. Goodbye 22 years of virginity! You forgot Leicester fucking City winning the Premier League>  > The Astros and Cubs win the World Series.

I've never seen anything like that happen before.Hey thereme tooI never thought I could be so happy about winning a game in week 17 that doesn't get us in or out of the playoffs. Spoiling the ravens is fucking hilarious and the bills getting in is great. Congrats I'm fucking crying Dilly Dilly with Dalton‚Äôs Willy WillyGets his TD, gets his playoff game. I just wish Freddy was still on the team somehow to enjoy it with us.CRACK OPEN A BEER AND DRINK!CLAP.  AND CLAP LIKE YOU'VE NEVER CLAPPED BEFORE.ClapAsk and you shall receive:  https://www.instagram.com/p/BdY7OUehVMr/Nah dude buffalos making the superbowl think about it the jags just lost 2 games they never should have so they can be beat and the bills beat the pats last year who's to say they can't do it again then for the championship game the bills will be on such a role they will be unstoppable so it doesn't matter who they are playing.I LOVE YOUI... I think I'm a Bengals fan now?Andy "Old Man Red Dick" Dalton delivered Christmas Part 2. Bless heem. I love you, and I love Andy Dalton so fucking much right now!aww, c'mon...I could find you....yeah, forget it....not one human in the world saw that as a possibility.'getting'  BRUH WE BEEN DRINK SINC 11AMESPN ranked a bubble playoff team 29? That's mentally deficient.ESPN 29TH RANKED SPORTS NEWSThat says a lot about the ineptitude of ESPN writers.it's all about the shitposting.  Our meme game has evolved and McDermott has felt all of our energy enter him in the most erotic way possible.2000 right here. I feel you.I'm glad the 2017 Bengals made some one happy.Dude, KYLE FUCKING WILLIAMS sent us to the playoffs on a game winning TD run.  Tell me 1 fucking person that would've predicted that.Same man, oh my god this is amazing I just can't even right nowI just cracked a Guinness to celebrate. I‚Äôm wearing my Manuel jersey to celebrate going out tonight I'm super happy for you guys. Lets make it a Vikings-Bills super bowl! Somebody has to win!Shotgun one of your dads beers and break the kitchen table. You are now reborn.At 16 I would probably be jerking off regardless of the outcomeGrab a table, ya dingus!CELEBRATE!I've watched the bills for 16 years, I cried.You're 16, the answer to everything is to jerk offIt was cincinatti who gave the bills a playoffs chance. Hot damn+The bengals doing some stuff How... Uh. How do you buy playoff ticketsI actually think the bills have a chance against the jags soAlready bought 7 ticketsWonderful day in my sportshuh? im happy for the happy for the billsAlso Pittsburgh is still hanging around like a bad smell.As soon as the time clock ran down I sobbed like a baby.We are all Buffalo on this blessed day*- cries in upstate -*We did it???? WE did it!!!! I'm gonna be blitzed.Don't worry we're sending wingsIm thinking now would be a great time to open up a shop in buffalo that only sells folding tables at a reasonable price. Lets be real if they make it all the way to the superbowl id probably be rich by February lolAfter 17 years, the Bills have finally found the hay in the needle pile.Fales looked pretty good for being 3rd stringer.  Bills only had an interception to end the game.GG dagreenman. I'd wish you a healthy return of Tannehill, but is that what you want?I have so many scars in my mouth that even after the cake is gone, I'm still expecting to get stabbed.  NFL will find a way to take us out of the playoffs. I know it.The razors were made out of cake this year. Go figure.Agreed friendTyrod Taylor is a 40 degree QB.I mean I still wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs elite, but I‚Äôd sure take him on the JetsThey have a decent shot at beating Jacksonville too since Bortles has gone to horseshit again.Seriously. Fucking love Tyrod. He just threw all the shit in the faces of his doubters. Go fucking get it, dude.Did you see him chilling on the bench during that brawl? Dude is cool af. Never lets stuff get to him. *First time this millenniumAwe I was happy for you guys :(Agree 100 percent. It felt like a victory for humanity. It was bigger than just the Ravens losing. It was about something right happening for a bunch of people who don't get to see something like this very often.Willing to bet it was a Ravens fan And they will all be named AndyI'mma just name it CincinnatusCough, western NYYou are now representing all of the Empire State. God bless you, good luck in the playoffs!Deal. If a patriots fan gets the top post on this thread I am gunna be pissedWHHHAPPPPI don't. I'm so conflicted right now. thanks i think?Sorry brother, they do not know are ways.Clap... the process worked.Probably would be in if they had an NFL kicker.RipSeriously. I didn't pay attention to the NFL at all this year until this week to see how the playoffs are gonna look. And fucking this is what I come back to? Dafuq happened??WE MADE IT, FAMNowhere is safeI'm pretty sure I'm gonna travel up to buffalo tonight if I can just hone in on where the best place to go is without completely losing my mindI don't think I've ever cheered so hard for a Bengals TD.Same. Baltimore is a scary team in the playoffs. It's like the George Costanza strategy. What you've been doing hasn't worked, so just do the oppositeTHIS IS NOT AN INDICTMENT ON TYRODBuffalonias are just a bunch of drunk fuckups who will do the complete opposite of what you tell them. I wouldn't have it any other way.USA Today doens't know shit More like USA Fucking YESTERDAYAt least we're here to keep to expectationsAnd on top of that: Jacksonville OR Buffalo will be in the 2nd round of the playoffs. Crazy.Glad for ya Bills gan, well deserved What is most absurd about this gif is that she does the whole thing while still holding onto her purse with one hand. Black Panther four-hour cut is looking fucking amazing. I'm desperate for the source of this.Western New YorkSUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY  Or is it a Saturday gameOh man, the Dildo thrower's mom can definitely get it.Free drinks for life?Sounds like Andy got some ass tonight.kissed by fireeee OUR SAVIORYou're welcome my brothers. We ate misery this year, but overcame adversity to propell our afc east kindred spirits Fuck you but also GG and I really hope Shady heals quicklyto he of the fire colored pubes: we owe muchYou weren't the only one.We were screaming in celebration when Dalton threw that TD. I‚Äôm sure lots of fans were cheering for Buffalo. 1 yard short!No Giants, no Ravens, our road is clear!The closest thing to a football fan in my family was my late great uncle, who was a devout Bengals fan. I feel somewhat guilty in not cheering for the "family" team, so I always kind of carry a torch for Cincy. That throw was top titties even if it meant Buffalo in the playoffs.is he expected to be back in a week?Bortles is another pretty good chanceIn a way, you can say that Dalton finally won a playoff game Build the Dalton statue in BuffaloAndy dalton is the best bills QB don‚Äôt @ me yea that 4th and 12. all playcalling there lolBills/Vikings Super Bowl would be litExcuse me, where can I pick up an application for Bills Mafia? I have a table lying around the house I don't really like and am willing to throw myself through.I can't imagine how Anquan Boldin must be feeling right now.      Dude joins the Bills then straight up quits, comes back a while later wanting to play with the Pats and now the Bills make playoffs. Just a dumb way to cap off such a great career. hmm this sounds familiar.../r/The_Cardale died for this.it's also makes us look better when someone from our division makes earns a wildcard Thanks man!  The Patriots are so good they transcend the idea of divisional rivalries.  The entire league is your rival.  Can't wait until you hate us again :)I mean, we tried to give them a chance!Haha that would have been amazing. If they make the Superbowl I will literally cry AhemI canNo, that's the Browns.    More that you're Rudy.  Way to sack that Quarterback, Rudy Bills!Where is the blood going?Congrats to both of us for making it.What year is it?!Plot twist! This guys 26!Leicester City winning the Premier League.There's something special about being the ruiner for a team that just feels great. Is it too late to sign him to the roster so he gets his ring when we win it all?McCoy is probably done. Can we sign Freddy? THEN BREAK A TABLE WHILE CLAPPING! THE ONLY RIGHT ANSWER!When even Patriots fans are initiated into the process. What a Wild year.This is the best thing I've ever seenBeautiful. Way to deliver, kind stranger.Dunno why, but that made some of the sour taste in my mouth go away.   - signed a Ravens fan.I've been looking for this.  Thank you!It's ESPN so, yeah.Why are you surprised. It's ESPN.Not low enough    Edit: talking about espn you doltsDankTwo words: Mike. Rodak.I'm so proud of us.Marvin is gone too, so that might be coolThis name triggers meCan we discuss the kyle williams touchdown,...l. god im so drunk I bought a random porter today that turned out to be way too strong.  I'm gonna put one back in your honor.first tie in Super Bowl historyIt would cause some kind of time-space paradox where the universe collapses into itself, because neither team could possibly win according to all the natural laws of the universe.What is drunk may never dieA baptism in Pabst and wooden splintersAnd god bless you for it.With money, apparently...

I hate it.Everyone else's sports*Mariners now have the longest playoff drought in sportshttp://i.imgur.com/fMVgtfy.jpgYou guys have an elite QB in Josh McCown. He's just a late bloomer.His great streak was at home and went to shit when they went on the road. I think they can take the bills at home but go no furtherWe'll take it.I think most of us would rather see the Bills get in the playoffs than the RavensMost of us are honestly happy for you. This is awesome, enjoy it!Why are so many Pats fans happy for the Bills?I dont know about the other teams but for the Rams, we got rid of Fisher and hired McBae McVay. Amazing what a huge difference replacing a head coach makes.Jaguars landed Tom Coughlin as their VP, fired Gus Bradley, signed some kick-ass people on defense, and also drafted Leonard Fournette, who just became the first Jaguars rookie since Fred Taylor to go for 1K yards his rookie season.Yeah, I would just run away from /r/NFL for like a year or six. I‚Äôd make a joke about how Cleveland‚Äôs 0-16 season overshadows Atlanta‚Äôs blown 25 point lead in the Super Bowl, but after seeing how hard they fucked us today, I‚Äôm in no position to make that joke.Everywhere is safe for Hue.I don't think I've ever cheered that hard for a BILLS TD. I leaped out of my seat and literally jumped so freakin' high I accidentally punched the ceiling fan. You and I both.That could work out in your favor.  "No baby, you SHOULDN'T invite your sister over for a 3some!"Cookie Cutter Newspaper. They did a prediction for a season one year and there were more than 256 wins for the season. Yeah they said we be undefeated.Nothing they can do but get better.There's a few connections, like the Jags head coach was the Bills HC and had it in his contract he could bug out and collect $4 million. Hard to say I blame him, and I didn't think he was that great, he called himself "Saint Doug".  Then we have marcel dareus, a huge contract the bills ate just to get rid of him, and he can be a beast but he has attitude issues.  This should be fun!!She catches a chair at the end holy fuck. I also like the "blink-and-you-miss-it" moment near the end where she catches the chair thrown at her one-handed, too.Bills are the in-market team for Binghamton. CNY gets no love üòí.And free tables. The Bills are sending a pile of wings down to Cinci for helpin us out  https://www.facebook.com/BuffaloBills/photos/a.75862470658.111835.72631215658/10155763806115659/?type=3&theatereasilyIf he drove to Buffalo, he could have his choice of as many girls he wanted.FIRST OF HIS NAMEMarvin went out with a bangSorry that we had to sacrifice you guys to the playoff gods. Eh I would have rather the Ravens made it, just so Patriots fans had to worry about them for another week.U wot m8A Coughlin team is in the playoffs thoughHe‚Äôll be healthy in time for the Super Bowl I‚Äôm sure.X-rays negative.  Dr. on Twitter said could be back - hard to tell on video.  But, not disastrous, he said.  I'll take it.  Because, you know, what the fuck else have i got?THANK YOU If you build a statue out of snow in Buffalo, it'll last until preseason, right?1st QB to lead the Bills to the playoffs since FlutieHe's definitely more popular in Buffalo right now than anywhere else, including Cincinatti.at the nearest foldable. Crashing through it will earn you the automatic admission. XDDo you eat your chicken wings with bleu cheese?   Do you drink Canadian beer?  #TOO LATE TO JOIN THE BANDWAGON NOW BUD. YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 17 YEARSTryouts will be at the tailgate in Jacksonville on SaturdayFuck him. There, I said it.Oh it's all over Twitter. Jeremy Maclin is getting shit as well.  edit: typoThe flashbacks have begun.#qualitywinsWhats important is that we spend this Bills thread discussing the Patriots.Just slipped through their hands.The dude has to catch that Same here. My wife knows that she isn't going to be able to talk to me for at least an hour afterwards. If we win I'll probably be literally sobbing from over 30 years of pent up disappointment all breaking free.BAH GAWD THAT'S SCOTT NORWOOD'S MUSIC! Directly to their erections I‚Äôd imagineIt stays in your blood vessels. By pinching your nose, you're blocking off the tear in the vessel wall, and the pressure helps it form a clot.tilting head up actual not great for you.  So says GI Joe commercial.Dilly Dilly Bills bro!1999, apparentlyI agree 100% but That is such a Philly thing to say.I mean with shady injured..........McCoy did get hurt today. I wonder if we could use an RB?I don't think it beats the all the Buffalo fans in the airport or whatever watching the same clip. Im not celebrating that until we announce another coach... Who isn't Hue.The good Kyle WilliamsIt was the most beautiful thing in years.  Kyle's given so much to this franchise through some of our darkest days.  Never got the love a five-time Pro-Bowler deserves, largely because he plays in Buffalo.  But even if the rest of the NFL forgets him, I hope he'll be enshrined on the walls of the Ralph someday.  For everything he's given the team and the city, the touchdown was really the least he deserved.Hopefully we can get a little AFC East playoff game going soon  I‚Äôd love that third try to beat you guys this season "That'll be $200" "OK and how much is that in pubes?"oooh thats right, well the mariners arent gonna end that drought any time soon lolPlus this just means the other 31 teams get to shit on the Browns extra hard today. Not only did they go 0-16, they now have the longest playoff drought. You virtue signaling assholes with your ‚Äúaww how cute you guys finally made the playoffs.‚Äù   Like we are your little cousin that beat you in a game of darts for the first time.  But, thank youI feel like this a realignment year. Bunch of crazy shit happened. As good as McVeigh has been, Les Snead was the real MVP this offseason. Signed you a completely new O line, signed some finally half decent WRs, all of which finally gave Gurley some breathing room.Coughlin. <3You think they'll finally win a game in six years... That's a long time The Lions have a running game?Lions firing a 9-7 coach that got them to the playoffs for 2/4 years. Browns still BrowninDid some gold coins fall out at least?We‚Äôre loved!!!*accidently slams sister through table and sets her on fire*We were the first team to be defeatedThat's been a challenge they've met the last two seasonsThey can also stay the same üëÄOR they could be the first team to ever go 0-16 in consecutive seasons.Round 1: revenge against marrone and dareus.   Round 2: destroy the evil empire and begin the revolution Round 3: collect our debt from the Steelers for putting them in the playoffs a couple years ago.    Round 4: bills vs Vikings, one of us breaks our curse. Everyone embrace. Happiness in all the land.furniture dodge ballSyracuse too...But most importantly free drinks.People laughed when I invested in the Buffalo Table Company, WHO LAUGHING NOW?Used to it at least we get to watch someone else get destroyed in the playoffs I figured the Ravens being in would clench Steelers fans butt holes as wellYeah people made that joke already but they really really need him next week.The reds certainly aren't helping We have our chili, friend. We have chiliThe comforting knowledge that you aren‚Äôt rooting for the *other* pro football team in Ohio?You could get Hue Jackson?And just like Flutie he won't start the playoff game for the Bills.And if the table's on fire, you also get an honorary case of Genny Cream Ale and a plate of Buffalo wings!Yes...  and yes...   Oh wait I'm already a Bills fan.  LETS GO BUFFALOOOOOO.   THE BILLS MAKE WANNA HNGHHHHH üò©Is that Rob Johnson's music?Look at me.   We are the SEC now. Funnily enough, that is literally the reason why the Bills own the tiebreaker over the Ravens and made the playoffs over themYikesThat look on Corey Coleman‚Äôs face combined with the Steelers DB trying to help him up describes it perfectly.  Also my lifePORK CHOP SANDWICHES!BUT ONLY ONE MAKES IT OUT ALIVE!!!!!! SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY ONE NIGHT ONLYGood... Rams, if you'll meet us in Minnesota, there's something we left about one yard short last time.Fuck bro, that means Y2K is happening Vet minimum deal thoughLink? Or is it posted somewhere and I haven't seen it?Radio post game said Marvin said he wanted to come back. This is like the wife asking to make a big life decision immediately after sex NO! YOU GUYS CAN TAKE HIM! WE'LL MISS HIM A LOT IN CLEVELAND! HE IS A TERRIFIC COACH AND REALLY RAISES THE SPIRITS OF THE TEAM WITH HIS LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY!The only non-Saints Jersey I own is Kyle Williams‚Äô. I grew up watching him and he was legitimately my hero when he was at LSU.no the mariners doThe real question is which will happen first a browns winning season or the next game of thrones book. My money is on George. Yeah so many that it crushed the folding table that was beneath said fan.  yeah but we were outdone hard in that category. But this time, I really don't know how they could get worse.If after a 1-15 season they managed to get worse, the abyss is the limit.I am ok with them taking the record for longest losing streak.He'll have the highest honor one can bestow upon someone - they will name a wing sauce after him.I hope the shrine you guys create for him is beautiful. FREE BUFFALO WINGS!It would make for an interesting game.  But the Steelers already have two wins in them this year and the Steelers match up in them better than the Patriots arguably.X rays are negative. He'll probably be a game-time decision.We make Cincinnati Chili every year tailgating for a Bills game. Tradition for 15+ years. My favorite meal of the year too. On pasta though?  Edit: In honor of you, pasta and chili all day every day.As a Bills fan from Alberta, not starting Flutie still cuts deep.TOO SOON HOLY SHIT GET THE FUCK OUT!You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge!!!!Be nice to the Bills, Frank. Correct, but we're also back at the beginning of the "wassup?!?!" Budweiser commercials, so definitly worth it. Fuck that, you really give a shit how much they pay that man.  Give him the max you can.  üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1804656242920660&id=112955302090771I saw it on Facebook earlier. Let me see if I can track it down. The official Sunday Night Football page posted it, I think. TBH I can't remember the last time the Mariners won a football game.Heat death of the universeOh, my sweet summer child...

Spicy Ginger SauceYou‚Äôre now an honorary moderator of /r/Cincinnati & /r/bengalsand hotdogs I still think Rob Johnson is the futureBut he's so tall and handsome! He played at USC! Did I mention he's tall?I'm gonna go invent Facebook. You can get in on it if you want and buy the Browns Spoiler warning: Wassup is already back, it just got a medieval makeover and became Dilly Dilly. Thanks! I love how both reactions have the same pattern. The initial cheering when he catches it past the sticks, and then the huge secondary cheer when he continues for the TDI can't even remember who the last quarterback to win a game for them was.I legitimately think the NFL might fold and disband as an organization before the Browns win a playoff gameI was having a really shitty night and this actually made me lol, thanks for that one pal :)I'm drunkenly laughing my ass off on a toilet.
